## 2.24.0 - 2026-08-09

A route-by-route frontend polish pass, plus the dashboard, import-history, prefetch, and RSU correctness work merged since 2.23.0.

### Added

- **Monthly income versus spending on Dashboard.** A grouped bar chart uses complete months only and explicitly names an excluded in-progress month.
- **Import history on Upload and Sync.** `GET /api/upload/history` and a responsive table show recent imports, timestamps, and processed/new/updated/already-present row counts.
- **Mobile table sorting.** Shared card-style tables retain sortable-column selection and ascending/descending controls when desktop headers are hidden.
- **RSU sell-to-cover reporting.** Vestings can record the net shares received alongside the gross taxable quantity, with both values shown at the same per-share price.

### Changed

- **Full frontend visual pass.** Every public and protected route was reviewed at desktop and phone widths. Shared contrast tokens, page labels, KPI cards, category rows, controls, chart tables, settings sections, merchant rows, GST summaries, tax copy, recurring summaries, and calendar layouts now use a more consistent responsive hierarchy.
- **Theme changes preserve page state.** Filters, tabs, searches, and forms remain mounted while chart containers alone redraw against the new resolved theme.
- **Bill Calendar keeps 44px day targets.** The month grid fits common phone widths and becomes horizontally scrollable only on narrower screens.
- **Cash Flow names the configured tax regime** on computed at-source TDS, and login prefetch now warms recurring, data-health, merchant, goals, and net-worth queries used by persistent navigation and common first visits.
- Updated supported frontend and backend dependencies while retaining the compatible TypeScript and React Router lines documented in #231.

### Fixed

- **RSU vest-date values now use vest-date FX.** Historical stock prices are converted with the exchange rate published for the vest date instead of today’s rate; failed historical lookups no longer silently substitute a current fallback.
- Theme toggles no longer reset route-local state, hidden accessible chart tables no longer widen layouts, and long recurring/bill summary values no longer truncate.
- Mobile transaction pagination scrolls the actual workspace container, custom budget dates receive and restore focus, and comparison selectors expose real labels.
- Future Year in Review heatmap dates are disabled and visually distinct; income rolling-average tooltips, category-row wrapping, merchant labels, and tax fallback contrast are corrected.

### Security

- Exchange-rate base currencies are restricted to three-letter codes before reaching upstream requests or log lines, preventing newline-based log injection.

## 2.23.0 - 2026-07-27

Two waves in one release: the workspace UI rework that had been sitting unreleased, and a correctness pass over money math, API contracts, and static analysis. Two on-screen figures intentionally change value, both called out below.

### Added

- **Workspace header** with the current page label, command-palette access, notifications, and a context-aware AI entry point.
- **Merchant Intelligence page (`/merchants`)**. Transaction notes are extracted into merchant labels with an ambiguity guard, so "Milk Shake - Apple" no longer books to the tech company. On a miss the whole normalized note is kept as a descriptor rather than its first word, which stopped both the silent drops and the over-merging of unrelated purchases into one label.
- **Data Health page (`/data-health`)**. Names the exact date the ledger ends and how many days are unimported, reports rows processed / inserted / already-present from the last import, and surfaces the placeholder-note, uncategorized, and future-dated counts that previously had no home. When the analytics rollups fall behind a committed import it says the displayed numbers are from the previous import and offers an in-place recompute.
- **`GET /api/calculations/income-facets`** returns every income category and subcategory bucket with its row count and total.
- **Income classification audit** in Settings. Income categories the ledger carries but no classification list claims are now listed with their transaction count and amount, each with a one-click bucket picker and a bulk "apply suggestions" action. Saved keys that match zero transactions (drifted spellings left behind after an import) are listed separately and can be removed.
- **From-scratch migration coverage** (`backend/tests/integration/test_migrations_from_scratch.py`) runs `alembic upgrade head` against an empty database, which is the case CI never exercised because production only ever does incremental upgrades.
- **IST ledger clock.** Date boundaries are resolved in Asia/Kolkata rather than the server's timezone, so a late-evening transaction no longer lands in the next day's totals.
- **Shared page recovery state** that keeps route context visible and lets users retry failed financial-data queries without reloading the application.
- **Authentication regression coverage** for provider loading/retry states, dialog focus management, and OAuth callback failures.
- **Stricter frontend accessibility checks** for labels, keyboard interaction, semantic tables, and accessible control names.
- **Product screenshots** for desktop and mobile landing-page presentation.

### Changed

- **Days of Buffering on the Dashboard now nets out debt.** It reads the split-aware liquid pool instead of a bare total across spendable accounts. A bare total has already lost the asset/liability split, so it could neither exclude parked deposits nor subtract what is owed. On the audit ledger the figure drops from 142 to 125 days, and the entire gap is liabilities the old path could not see: 57,812.58 of credit-card debt and 4,668.14 across four overdrawn wallets. The lower number is the correct one.
- **Savings targets are split by definition.** `/budgets` measures savings as the change in the investment perimeter; `/spending-analysis` measures income minus comparable spending. These answer two legitimately different questions and are roughly 2x apart on real data, yet both were scored against a single `savings_target_percent`, so one page could say "under target" while the other said "on track". Each definition now carries its own target. The two numerators are deliberate and are not reconciled.
- **Capital loss is separated from consumption**, so a fall in investment value no longer reads as spending.
- **Every sort has an explicit comparator.** Implicit lexicographic ordering silently mis-sorted numeric and date columns.
- **Complete workspace UI rework.** The shell, sidebar, mobile navigation, page headers, metric cards, controls, transaction filters, tables, charts, settings, home page, upload flow, and key planning pages now share one compact ledger-oriented visual system.
- **Responsive behavior** was tightened across desktop and phone layouts, including stable workspace dimensions, safe-area handling in the global header, mobile transaction presentation, and non-overlapping demo/chat/navigation surfaces.
- **Home and sign-in flow** now use the real dashboard screenshots, clearer calls to action, a retryable provider-loading state, keyboard focus trapping, Escape dismissal, and focus restoration.
- **Protected data pages** now distinguish loading, empty, and failed-query states instead of rendering failed requests as valid zero-value dashboards.
- **Dense routes and controls** were split into focused components, aligned to shared buttons, inputs, selects, responsive tables, and shorter reduced-motion-aware transitions.
- **Local API routing** now defaults to the same-origin Vite proxy. `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is required only for split production hosting.
- **Theme-aware global feedback** now follows the resolved Light or Dark theme.
- **Static-analysis baseline**: ruff reports zero findings across 25 rule families, mypy is clean over 156 source files, and SonarCloud reports zero open issues. The frontend lint tier was widened to `recommendedTypeChecked` over `src/**`, which is what catches `any` flowing through a value.
- **Documentation refresh** aligns the READMEs, handbook, route catalog, API reference, database guide, calculations, architecture, testing guide, deployment notes, migration notes, and diagrams with the 2.23.0 codebase.

### Fixed

- **Goal cards no longer crash on a goal with no start date.** `financial_goals.created_at` was created nullable and never altered, and the serializer derives both `start_date` and `created_at` from that one column, so any row written before the model-level default arrives as `null`. The TypeScript type declared it non-null, so the card passed `null` into `parseLocalDate`, which threw on `.slice` -- and a throw during render unmounts the whole card, not just the on-pace indicator. The wire type now admits null and the pace calculation is skipped when there is no timeline to measure against.
- **`alembic upgrade head` works against an empty database.** It previously failed with `ValueError: No such index: 'ix_fy_summaries_fiscal_year'`, dropping an index that the creating migration never created. Not reachable in production, where only incremental upgrades run.
- **Two features that returned HTTP 422.** FastAPI reads a field's source from the handler signature, so posting query parameters to handlers that declare a request body failed validation. Found by diffing the OpenAPI schema against the client; neither TypeScript nor CI could see it.
- **`Refunds & Cashbacks` key drift** zeroed 54,700 of offsetting credits because a plural spelling never matched the singular key.
- **Anomaly deviation percentages were 100x too small** -- the formatter applied no x100.
- **Essential-category defaults were dead code**, because `"[]"` is a truthy string and so the fallback never ran.
- **Cognitive complexity** reduced below the threshold in `spending_rule.py`, `fy_summaries.py`, `summaries.py`, `investmentUtils.ts`, and `CreditCardHealth.tsx`. The `CreditCardHealth` extraction was checked against 60,000 differential cases with zero divergence and 10 of 10 injected mutants caught; the `investmentUtils` split against 85,000 cases and 29 mutants.
- **A React component defined inside its parent** was hoisted to module scope, which stops the subtree unmounting on every render.
- `/home` now redirects to `/dashboard` instead of rendering the public landing page inside the authenticated workspace.
- Demo mode returns an empty AI tool registry without making a backend request.
- Sign-in provider failures remain distinguishable from a valid but unconfigured provider list.
- Financial query failures no longer appear as empty ledgers, zero balances, or missing recurring items.
- Mobile dashboard figures, table amounts, filters, and page actions no longer clip or overflow at 320px and 375px widths.
- Calendar cells, settings controls, RSU vesting entries, upload feedback, and comparison tabs stay readable and touch-friendly across phone, tablet, and pointer-coarse layouts.

### Security

- CI and migration jobs now require committed Python lock data, reject source and project builds during dependency installation, and run tools without an implicit dependency sync.
- GitHub Pages installs the frozen pnpm lockfile with dependency lifecycle scripts disabled.
- Patched development dependency alerts for `shell-quote`, `brace-expansion`, `fast-uri`, `sharp`, and `serialize-javascript`; root and frontend pnpm audits now report zero vulnerabilities.

### Developer experience

- **Agent git worktrees no longer break the local gates.** A worktree checked out under `frontend/` gave typescript-eslint two tsconfig roots, so the pre-commit hook failed repo-wide with zero real lint problems, and vitest counted the duplicated suite (147 files / 1741 tests against CI's 116 / 1383). `eslint.config.js` now ignores `.claude` and vitest excludes `**/.claude/**`.

## 2.22.0 - 2026-07-09

RSU vesting schedule overhaul: vested vs upcoming grouping with vest-date valuation.

### Added

- **Vested / Upcoming grouping in RSU Grants** (Settings > Income & Salary Structure). Each grant's vesting table is split into a dimmed "Vested" section (date <= today) and an "Upcoming" section, both sorted chronologically. Rows re-sort on date-input blur (not per keystroke, so rows don't jump under the cursor), and grants saved before this change are normalized on load. The summary line now splits into "Vested: N shares (value)" and "Upcoming: N shares (value)" instead of one combined total.
- **Vest-date price locking (`price_at_vest`).** Once a vesting date passes, the historical close for that date is fetched once and stored on the vesting, so realized RSU income stops drifting with the current stock price. Falls back to the grant's current price when the lookup fails (delisted ticker, upstream hiccup); editing a vested row's date clears the locked price so it re-fetches. Backend: `GET /api/stock-price/{symbol}?on_date=YYYY-MM-DD` returns the close on that date (or the nearest prior trading day within a week, covering weekends/market holidays) plus an `as_of` field; `RsuVesting` schema gains optional `price_at_vest`.
- **`lib/rsuVesting.ts`** -- single source of truth for `isVested` / `sortVestings` / `vestingPrice` / `splitRsuTotals`, shared by the settings UI, the multi-year tax projection (`projectionCalculator.ts`), and the TDS schedule (`tdsScheduleCalculator.ts`).

### Changed

- **Projection math treats vested rows as realized income**: `getRsuVestingsByFY` values them at the locked vest-date price and never applies the stock-appreciation assumption to them; upcoming vestings keep the projection behavior (current price grown by appreciation %/yr).
- **RSU grant state handlers extracted** from `SalaryStructureSection.tsx` into a `useRsuGrants` hook; per-grant vesting table extracted into `VestingTable.tsx`.

## 2.21.0 - 2026-07-07

Rule-based auto-categorization, transaction tags, and saved filter views (PR #203). Backend: categorization rules engine with retroactive apply, transaction tags, saved views CRUD. Frontend: tag chips + filtering on Transactions, saved-views menu, rules settings UI.

## 2.20.0 - 2026-07-04 -- was `Unreleased` (PR #202)

Comprehensive hardening wave landing on the branch: security tightening (BYOK key split + HKDF, token-version revocation, per-user rate limits, DB-level cascade), the anomaly-detection rewrite, the 50/30/20 Budget Rule page, and a design-system consistency pass that trims data past today across every historical chart and codifies the money-cell pattern.

### Added

- **50/30/20 Budget Rule page (`/budget`).** Replaces the old category-CRUD `/budgets`. Three side-by-side bucket cards (Needs / Wants / Savings) show target vs actual with a delta score; the breakdown table caps each bucket at top-10 categories with an "Other (N more)" rollup that expands inline. Period picker covers 1yr, 2yr, 5yr, All-time, Custom. Backend endpoint `POST /api/analytics/v2/spending-rule` classifies categories via word-boundary regex (fixes Education-not-in-Needs bug), unions user overrides with defaults (fixes first-override-drops-defaults bug), and relabels compound `Transfer: Bank: X -> Y: Z` rows to instrument names (Stocks, Mutual Funds, PPF, etc.).
- **`<Money>` primitive** (`frontend/src/components/ui/Money.tsx`). Codifies the canonical amount-cell rule set: `shrink-0 text-right tabular-nums whitespace-nowrap font-medium` plus `sm|md|lg|xl` width presets so flex parents can't compress the amount. Prevents the `₹12,91` truncation bug that occurred inside 33%-wide columns. Barrel-exported from `@/components/ui`; migrated `CategoryTable`, `CategoryBreakdown` (both top-level and subcategory rows).
- **`capEndDateAtToday()` and `capSeriesToToday<T>()`** in `frontend/src/lib/dateUtils.ts`. Historical time-series charts across the app no longer render a flat-zero tail past today. `capEndDateAtToday()` is applied inside `getAnalyticsDateRange()` so it cascades through `useAnalyticsTimeFilter`, `useDashboardMetrics`, and every analytics query hook without per-caller edits. `capSeriesToToday<T>(rows, key)` is generic on row shape with ISO-string comparison for use with in-memory month or day series. Projection pages (FIRE, tax-planning multi-year, retirement forecasting) intentionally build their own future ranges and are untouched.
- **Anomaly detection rewrite** (`core/analytics/anomalies.py`). Median + MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) with a rolling per-category baseline; robust to skew and single-transaction outliers.
- **DB-level `ON DELETE CASCADE`** on every `user_id` foreign key. Migration `20260704_1100_add_ondelete_cascade_user_fks.py` handles both PostgreSQL (`ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT / ADD CONSTRAINT`) and SQLite (`batch_alter_table(recreate="always", naming_convention=...)` with FK-name reflection to avoid the duplicate-FK trap that happens when `create_foreign_key` runs without an explicit `drop_constraint` in the same batch).

### Changed

- **`PageContainer` migration** for 5 pages (Anomaly, FIRE, Transactions, More, SubscriptionTracker). Hand-rolled `min-h-dvh p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8` + `max-w-7xl mx-auto space-y-6` scaffolds replaced with the shared primitive.
- **Palette drift fixes.** `year-in-review/types.ts` heatmap band colors moved from slate-tinted rgba to `${rawColors.app.red}<alpha>` template literals (theme-aware). New `rawColors.onAccent` token replaces raw `'#fff'` in `PeriodSelectors`. `CommandPalette` inline shadow moved to the shared `var(--glass-shadow-ultra)` token + app-blue ambient glow.
- **Year-in-review Monthly Breakdown** now slices `MONTHS_SHORT` at today's month for the current calendar/fiscal year (no more empty bars for future months). FY wrap handled via `((nowMonth - (fyStart - 1) + 12) % 12) + 1`.
- **CI on Python 3.13 everywhere**, added job timeouts.

### Fixed

- Cascade migration created duplicate FKs on SQLite (drop + create in same batch = REPLACE, but pure `create_foreign_key` alone APPENDS).
- Frontend crash `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'start')` on the budget page in demo mode -- demo axios adapter's catch-all `/analytics/v2/*` returned the wrong shape for spending-rule.
- SonarCloud MAJOR bug: identical ternary branches in a `capForBar` variable that always resolved to `target`.
- Substring false positives in investment-account classifier (`'rd'` matched inside `"weird broker xyz"`); replaced exact-match with word-boundary regex.
- Failed main deploy on 2026-07-03 (transient GitHub Pages API error); rerun succeeded.

### Security

- **Split BYOK encryption key from JWT secret.** Uses HKDF for v2 keys with per-ciphertext salt; JWT rotation no longer invalidates stored API keys.
- **Server-side token revocation via `User.token_version`.** Logout and account reset increment the stored version; outstanding access and refresh tokens then fail verification server-side.
- **Per-authenticated-user rate limits** on `/api/upload` and `/api/ai/bedrock/chat` (was IP-keyed).

## 2.19.0 - 2026-06-28

A premium **light theme**, a world-class UI/UX elevation pass, and an information-architecture restructure. Adds a Light/Dark/System toggle and makes the entire app render flawlessly in both themes, driven by live design-system research (Radix Colors, Material 3, Apple HIG), a 14-lens UI audit, and a 5-lens IA audit. Frontend-only -- no API, schema, or backend changes. Dark theme is preserved byte-for-byte.

### Added

- **Overview page (`/overview`).** A single "whole picture" view composing existing data (income/spending/net-saved/savings-rate KPIs, budgets-at-risk, goals progress, top income vs spending) with deep links to each detail page. Sits beside Dashboard, which stays the configurable widget board.
- **Premium light theme + Light/Dark/System toggle.** A warm off-white palette (LAB surfaces, white cards lifting off the page, soft layered shadows, AA-contrast accents) controlled entirely from `index.css` tokens. Switch via the sidebar cycle button or Settings > Appearance; an anti-flash inline script applies the stored theme before first paint, and `System` follows the OS preference live. The public landing page gets its own toggle in the header.
- **Theme-aware, reactive charts.** 20 new `--chart-*` tokens (axis, grid, tooltip, reference-line, label colors) flip with the theme; Recharts/SVG colors resolve through `rawColors` at runtime (CSS `var()` does not work in SVG attributes). All derived palettes (`CHART_COLORS`, `metricColorConfig`, category colors) rebuild in place on toggle, and the routed view remounts on theme change so charts repaint without a reload.

### Changed

- **One source of truth for color.** Swept the remaining hardcoded color literals app-wide (`text-white`/`bg-white/N`/`bg-black/N`/gray-family/SVG hex/inline rgba) onto semantic tokens (`text-foreground`, `bg-surface-*`, `bg-[var(--overlay-N)]`, `border-[var(--hairline-N)]`), so a single token edit re-themes everything. White-on-solid-accent button text is the only intentional exception.
- **World-class UI/UX elevation (52 surgical improvements):** `tabular-nums` on currency/KPI/table numbers so digits stop shifting width; accessible names on chart primitives + icon-only controls (listbox/option roles on dropdowns, aria-valuenow on the FIRE slider); page headers now mirror the canonical sidebar labels (Expense Analysis, Cash Flow, Income Tax, Budget Manager, ...); 2-column KPI grids on phones with >=44px touch targets; standardized loading/empty states; shared press/hover micro-interactions (motion kept fully visible).
- **Information-architecture restructure** (from a 5-lens IA audit). Sidebar reordered to the money decision-flow and regrouped: Net Worth + Investments merged into one **Wealth** section, the dead-end single-item Transactions section folded into a new **Data** section (with Upload & Sync elevated out of the icon bar), and Tracking renamed **Commitments**. **Settings** regrouped from 11 flat sections into four task groups (Money Setup, Categories & Classification, Profile & Display, Advanced) with essential setup expanded first. Budget Defaults and Anomaly Detection now also appear as collapsible panels on their own feature pages (context-of-use), Income Tax and GST cross-link, the mobile More tab shows an alert badge (anomalies + over-budget), and the Dashboard shows an upload CTA when a new user has no data. New tokens `--color-on-accent` / `--color-on-warning` / `--modal-backdrop` name the white-on-accent / black-on-warning / dialog-scrim conventions; the mobile browser chrome (`theme-color`) now tracks the active theme.

### Fixed

- **Theme switch desync** -- a short-lived `theme-transition` class gives every element one uniform 300ms cross-fade so the whole UI flips in sync instead of parts easing at different speeds.
- Removed an erroneous static `aria-current="page"` on sidebar/mobile-tab `NavLink`s (every item announced as the current page; `NavLink` already sets it on the active link) and a dead `getStoredTheme()` helper.

---

## 2.18.0 - 2026-06-28

A frontend-only UX, visualization, and mobile pass. No API, schema, or backend changes -- every commit touches `frontend/src`. Driven by a senior-design audit of the shared UI primitives and every page, a data-visualization-fit audit (~295 elements scored), and a live mobile audit at 390px. Desktop layout is preserved throughout (mobile changes are gated behind `sm:`/`lg:`/`useIsMobile`).

### Added

- **Shared UI primitives** so pages stop hand-rolling equivalents: `PageContainer` (one centered page scaffold), `Spinner` (one `role="status"` spinner), `ProgressBar` (fill + target tick + bullet-graph threshold bands), and chart helpers `referenceLine()` (peak/avg/target/goal/zero variants) + `currencyTooltipFormatter()`. `MetricCard` gained an opt-in `hero` size; `StandardBarChart` gained `onBarClick` + `ariaLabel`; `DataTable` gained a sticky/scrollable header.
- **Expected-return benchmark line on the SIP Growth Path chart.** A third series shows what the portfolio *should* be worth each historical month if every contribution had compounded at the assumed return from its own investment date -- so the actual-value line reads as ahead of or behind target. Plus a "Today" reference line marking the history/projection boundary. Covered by unit tests.
- **Informative context across pages, reusing data already on the page** (no new fetches): Net Worth KPIs get month-over-month deltas + trend sparklines + leverage/account-count context; Income shows primary-source share and a growth sparkline; savings-rate / utilization / recurring-coverage bare percentages become progress bars with a target tick; Comparison quick-stats get signed deltas; Bill Calendar leads with a due-date countdown; Anomalies show an expected-vs-actual mini-comparison; Budgets show a per-row month-end pace projection.
- **`DataTable` mobile card-stack mode** (`mobileCards`) -- below 640px, wide tables render as stacked label/value cards (a `mobilePrimary` column becomes the card title) instead of horizontally scrolling.

### Changed

- **Charts reshaped to fit their data** (data-viz-fit audit): the Income/Expense Flow Sankey now caps to the top 8 per side with an explicit "Other (n)" node so flows reconcile with the KPI totals (was a silent top-10 truncation); the Budget utilization radar and Year-in-Review day-of-week radar became sorted/grouped bars; the FIRE variant tiles became one shared-axis bar; the Returns monthly net became a single signed bar; Top Merchants donut became a ranked list with inline bars; the Spending multi-category / subcategory lines default to per-period (not cumulative) and cap to a top-N + "Other"; the SIP NPS allocation became a 100% stacked bar.
- **App-wide UX consistency**: every chart got an accessible name; hand-rolled spinners became the shared `Spinner`, bare empties became `EmptyState`, and `'...'`/text loaders became shaped skeletons; flat hand-rolled tables (GST, investment accounts, comparison categories) migrated to the sortable `DataTable`; the time-range brush slider got a rounded grip with grip-lines.
- **Mobile-first polish on every data page**: KPI/stat grids show 2-up on phones (were single-column), oversized hero numbers truncate instead of clipping, chart heights shrink on small screens, toggle/legend/pill rows wrap, and interactive controls (toggles, FY navigators, pagination, icon buttons, form inputs) meet the 44px touch-target minimum.

### Fixed

- **Wide data tables horizontal-scrolled on phones** (Tax slab table reached ~677px). They now card-stack or drop low-priority columns on mobile; the pivoted multi-year projection table keeps its label column pinned while FY columns scroll.
- **Dashboard expense pie/legend colors could mismatch** -- palette colors were assigned by pre-sort index. Colors are now assigned after the value sort.
- **Dashboard income/expense legends ran past the 8-slice pie** -- capped to 7 + a "+N more" row so the visible rows reconcile with the total.
- A pre-existing `QuickInsights.biggest_expense` crash in demo mode (missing optional chaining), surfaced during the live verification pass.

---

## 2.17.0 - 2026-06-27

A performance + data-architecture pass: analytics pages that pulled the entire transaction ledger into the browser now read server-side aggregations, and the `transactions` index set was rationalised. No breaking API changes; all numbers verified against the real database with independent SQL oracles.

### Added

- **`cohort_spending` rollup table** (migration `cohort_spending_2026`) -- average expense per temporal cohort (day-of-week / day-of-month / month-of-year) with occurrence-correct divisors, populated on every upload refresh. Powers the "Spending Patterns" widget server-side.
- **New read endpoints** under `/api/calculations` and `/api/transactions` that move client-side computation to the backend: `transactions/facets` (dropdowns + type counts), `quick-insights` (Dashboard band: cashback, median/avg/biggest expense, weekend split, peak weekday, transfers), `data-date-range` (time-filter nav bounds), `income-analysis` (income totals/trend/cashback), `category-monthly-history` (sparkline), `category-daily-series` (time-series charts), plus `/api/analytics/v2/cohort-spending`. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

### Changed

- **Analytics pages no longer ship the full ledger to the browser.** Migrated TransactionsPage, PeriodComparison, CohortSpendingAnalysis, QuickInsights, FIRECalculator, CategoryBreakdown, MultiCategoryTimeAnalysis, EnhancedSubcategoryAnalysis, IncomeAnalysis, RecurringTransactions, BudgetTracker, and CommandPalette onto server-side aggregations / existing rollups. Computations that bundle user preferences or heavy projection math (tax, GST config table, net-worth/XIRR projections, financial-health CFP score) intentionally stay client-side to avoid duplicating preference logic.
- **`transactions` index set rationalised** (migration `optimize_tx_indexes_2026`). Replaced the drifted historical indexes with six canonical user-scoped, equality-first composites `(user_id, date)`, `(user_id, type, date)`, `(user_id, category)`, `(user_id, account)`, `(user_id, from_account)`, `(user_id, to_account)`. Non-user-scoped indexes (`date`, `type`, `category`, ...) were dropped -- the planner never used them for this app's user-scoped queries, so they only taxed writes. Verified with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`. The migration is idempotent (inspects live indexes) so it converges despite prior drift.
- **`/api/calculations/monthly-aggregation`** now also returns `income_count` / `expense_count` per month (used by PeriodComparison instead of a separate full-ledger fetch).

### Fixed

- **Dashboard / analytics cards showed ₹0 or "NaN days"** when the running dev backend was stale (started before the new routes existed). The code and migrations were correct; restarting the backend with `--reload` loads the new endpoints. Net Cashback (₹41,980), Median Transaction, Weekend split, Peak Spending Day, and Days of Buffering now populate from verified server-side values.

---

## 2.16.0 - 2026-06-27

A correctness + reliability pass driven by a multi-agent audit (bug-finder matrix with adversarial verification, an assumption-research sweep cross-checked against official sources, and a 100-category scorecard). One new user-facing setting; the rest are fixes. No breaking API changes.

### Added

- **"Salary recorded net of TDS" toggle** (Settings -> Financial). Controls how Tax Planning interprets recorded salary: on (default) treats it as net of TDS and backs out the implied gross to show tax already deducted; off treats the recorded amount as the taxable gross and computes tax on it directly. New ``salary_is_net_of_tds`` column on ``user_preferences`` (migration ``salary_tds_2026``).
- **Expense Trend chart on the Spending Analysis page** -- monthly spending with a 3-month rolling average and a peak reference line, mirroring the Income Trend chart on Income Analysis (red/expense semantics, timezone-safe month labels).
- **EPF withdrawal taxability is now a user setting** (Settings -> Financial). EPF inflows are treated as exempt by default (Section 10(12) -- withdrawals after 5 years of continuous service are tax-free); a toggle plus a 0-100% field lets you count a chosen fraction as taxable. Replaces a hardcoded 50% taxable assumption that had no basis in EPF rules. New ``epf_withdrawal_taxable`` / ``epf_taxable_percent`` columns on ``user_preferences`` (migration ``a1b2c3d4e5f6``).

### Fixed

- **Chart correctness sweep (28 issues from a vigorous audit of every chart against empty/single/all-zero/negative/NaN/many-category/cross-FY data).** Highlights: the cash-flow confidence cone no longer paints a solid black wedge below zero when the forecast dips negative (rebuilt as stacked baseline+range areas); single-data-point line/area charts now show a visible dot instead of rendering blank (net worth, returns, trends, income); the effective-tax-rate "You" marker no longer vanishes (numeric X scale); many-category pies cap at 8 slices with an "Other" bucket so the palette never repeats on adjacent wedges; the seasonal and day-of-month cohort averages divide by real per-bucket occurrences (months that actually contain that day / years that contain that month) instead of a global span count; several tooltip/brush/axis date labels and the recurring next-date were shifted a day for non-UTC users; the GST-by-slab pie drops the empty 0% (exempt) slice; the Pareto chart actually two-tones its vital-few vs trivial-many bars; the budget radar caps at 8 spokes; the all-deficit savings "peak" line shows the true (negative) maximum; the net-worth stacked view is disabled (with a hint) when the range dips negative; a dead spending-donut drill-down was removed.
- **GST 2.0 (effective 2025-09-22), verified against the GST Council / incometax.gov.in.** The GST estimator used the retired 12% and 28% slabs. It is now date-aware: transactions before the cutover use the legacy table ``[0,3,5,12,18,28]``; on/after use ``[0,3,5,18,40]`` (12% and 28% removed, 40% luxury/sin de-merit added; insurance -> Nil, electricity/water -> exempt, everyday apparel/household -> 5%, electronics 28% -> 18%). The slab breakdown buckets on the union of both sets so a fiscal year spanning the cutover keeps each rate on its own slab.
- **Old-regime Section 87A is a hard cliff again.** Marginal relief was being applied to the old regime; relief exists only in the new regime, so the old regime under-taxed the band just above the 5L ceiling.
- **Tax-planning gross-from-net uses the selected regime's slabs** (was always new-regime), so the displayed gross/net/tax are mutually consistent.
- **Tax-planning no longer falls back to gross inflow** when nothing is classified as taxable -- that counted transfers/refunds/investment returns as salary. It now uses only classified taxable income (0 when nothing is classified).
- **EPF maturity projection** uses the statutory employer split (12% of basic minus the EPS diversion, 8.33% of the capped 15,000 wage) instead of mirroring the employee %, and the current 8.25% rate (was a stale 8.15%).
- **Cross-user data leak on shared browsers.** Budget, account-classification, investment-account, and preferences stores persisted to ``localStorage`` under static keys and survived logout. They are now reset on logout and account deletion.
- **Finance math:** returns-analysis monthly ROI was an annual CAGR divided by 12 (linear) -> proper monthly compounding; the period comparison's "avg daily spend" divided by a hardcoded 30 regardless of range -> actual day count; the cohort day-of-week average divided by a broken week count -> real weekday occurrences; the Sankey empty state gated on a node count that was never zero -> gates on links.
- **Backend:** amounts now convert straight to ``Decimal`` (HALF_UP) instead of rounding through ``float`` (2.675 -> 2.68); the ``list_accounts`` AI tool replaced 5N+1 queries with grouped aggregates and gained the result cap every other list tool has; three anomaly queries now honour the excluded-accounts filter; a duplicate ``NormalizationError`` class meant row-level normalization errors escaped every handler as a raw 500; transfers between two investment accounts no longer double-count as inflow; the transactions end-date filter is inclusive of the whole day; ``create_goal`` returns 400 (not 500) on a malformed target date.
- **A timezone bug class across many sites** (UTC-parsed dates read with local getters, shifting the calendar day for non-UTC users): year-in-review heatmap, recent transactions, bill calendar, ISO-week bucketing, axis tick labels, financial-health month boundary, the category sparkline, and a month-label sweep. Consolidated shared date helpers (``parseLocalDate``, ``weekdayOf``, ``toLocalDateKey``, ``formatMonthKey``, ``formatDate``).
- **Mutations no longer fail silently** -- a global error toast surfaces any failed save/delete that doesn't handle its own error (AI mode toggle, goals, recurring-item CRUD).
- **Exchange-rate fallback table** corrected to verified ECB values for its stated date (was ~13% stale).

### Changed

- CORS now uses the computed origin allowlist instead of a wildcard; logging honours ``LEDGER_SYNC_LOG_LEVEL`` instead of a hardcoded level.
- ``min-h-screen`` -> ``min-h-dvh`` across all page roots so layout tracks the mobile dynamic viewport.
- Removed the ``date-fns`` dependency (replaced its three usages with a timezone-safe ``formatDate`` helper).

### Security

- Pinned ``msgpack>=1.2.1`` to clear GHSA-6v7p-g79w-8964 (transitive, dev-only via cachecontrol).

### Accessibility

- ``aria-label`` on icon-only buttons across 13 components; the chat panel is a labelled dialog with a live region and alert role; a ``prefers-reduced-motion`` block flattens CSS animations under the OS reduce flag (motion stays visible by default).

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for the old-regime 87A cliff, the EPF statutory split, EPF taxable-fraction, GST 2.0 date-aware rates, the timezone date helpers, and the normalizer's Decimal rounding. 255 frontend + 215 backend tests pass; ruff, mypy, tsc, and eslint clean.

---

## 2.15.0 - 2026-06-07

Dependency and pipeline maintenance. Took every held-back major version to latest behind a restored CI gate, unblocked the frontend deploy, and cleared two security advisories. No feature changes; no API contract breaks.

### Changed

- **All held major dependencies bumped to latest, one verified bump per commit.** Frontend: TypeScript 5.9 -> 6.0 (removed deprecated ``baseUrl`` from ``tsconfig.app.json``; ``@/*`` resolves via ``moduleResolution: bundler``), Vite 7 -> 8 (Rolldown + Oxc engine; ``manualChunks`` object form converted to function form; build ~17s -> ~0.6s), ``@vitejs/plugin-react`` 5 -> 6, ``lucide-react`` 0.577 -> 1.17, ``jsdom`` 28 -> 29. Backend: ``cryptography`` 46 -> 48 (AES-256-GCM key-encryption round-trip re-verified), ``mypy`` 1.19 -> 2.1 (``--strict-bytes`` / ``--local-partial-types`` now default-on; zero new errors across 123 files), ``rich`` 14 -> 15, ``typer`` 0.24 -> 0.26. ``vite-plugin-pwa`` confirmed generating the service worker under Rolldown.
- **CI re-enabled as a real gate.** ``ci.yml`` was reduced to security-scan only; broken TypeScript or failing tests could pass. Restored a frontend job (lint -> ``tsc`` build -> vitest via the shared workflow) and an inline backend job (ruff + mypy + pytest, no error-swallowing), both on ``pull_request``. Pinned pnpm via ``packageManager`` and third-party actions to commit SHAs.

### Fixed

- **GitHub Pages deploy unblocked.** ``pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`` failed with ``ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH`` because a vite security bump changed ``pnpm.overrides`` without regenerating the lockfile. Regenerated; pinned pnpm so local, deploy, and CI resolve identically.
- **Recharts 3 + react-hooks 7 fallout.** 23 ``Tooltip`` formatter type errors (``value`` is now ``ValueType``) and 4 ``set-state-in-effect`` lint errors from the earlier major bump, which the security-only CI never caught but the deploy build did.
- **Bedrock client timeouts bounded** (Release It!). ``boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')`` inherited botocore's 60s/60s defaults; on Vercel's 10s ceiling a slow call hung the function. Set ``connect_timeout=3, read_timeout=8, max_attempts=1``.
- **Misplaced ``import pytest``** below the module docstring (F404 + E402).

### Security

- **``serialize-javascript`` pinned to >=7.0.5** via ``pnpm.overrides`` -- cleared two Dependabot alerts (1 high RCE, 1 medium DoS) on a transitive build-time dependency.

### Refactored

- Extracted ``MS_PER_DAY`` / ``MS_PER_YEAR`` / ``MONTHS_PER_YEAR`` and EPF statutory constants, replacing inlined literals (Clean Code G25/G5). ``getAnalyticsDateRange`` takes a params object (F1). Backend ``apply_excluded_accounts_filter`` helper removes a filter clause triplicated across three files (G5). Split ``ReturnsAnalysisPage`` (537 -> 391) and ``SpendingAnalysisPage`` (456 -> 260) into hook + utils per the repo convention (APOSD). Named ``NotificationCenter`` thresholds; deduped ``analyticsV2`` response-unwrap via ``getWrapped<T>``.

### Tests

- Backend 135 pass (ruff + mypy clean under the new majors); frontend 177 pass (lint + ``tsc`` + build clean under Vite 8 / TS 6).

---

## 2.14.0 - 2026-05-17

Calculation correctness audit batch -- three backend bugs caught while reviewing every aggregation path. No frontend changes; no API contract breaks.

### Fixed

- **Net Worth API: cumulative series now seeded with pre-window opening balance.** ``GET /api/calculations/daily-net-worth?start_date=...`` previously reset the cumulative ``net_worth`` series to 0 on day one of the window, ignoring all transactions before ``start_date``. A user filtering "Last 6 months" saw their chart begin at zero instead of their actual cumulative cashflow at that point. When ``start_date`` is set we now compute ``opening_balance = SUM(income) - SUM(expense)`` for transactions strictly before it and seed the cumulative series with that value. Transfers excluded (matches existing model). The response also includes ``opening_balance`` so frontends can render a starting-balance annotation.
- **Time-range filters now anchor on ``now()``, not the user's most recent transaction.** ``THIS_MONTH``, ``LAST_3_MONTHS``, etc. used to anchor on the latest transaction date so a user with stale data saw old months under "This Month" labels. Anchored on ``datetime.now(UTC)`` now: "This Month" = current calendar month, "Last 3 Months" = first day of (now - 2 months) through now (calendar-aligned, no partial-month tails). Stale data legitimately yields empty filtered results -- correct behaviour. Two parallel implementations both fixed: ``api/analytics_helpers._get_time_range_dates`` (DB query) and ``core/time_filter.TimeFilter`` (in-memory list).
- **Recurring detection: closed gaps between frequency bands.** The 2.10.0 release made ``_FREQ_BANDS`` "contiguous" via integer endpoints ``[(4, 10), (11, 19), (20, 49), ...]`` checked with ``lo <= avg_diff <= hi``. But ``avg_diff`` is a float (mean of integer day-gaps), so half-integer values 10.5, 19.5, 49.5, 79.5, 129.5, 269.5 fell through every band -> ``frequency = None`` -> recurring patterns silently dropped. Real-world example: a salary every 7 days plus a monthly top-up landing some weeks averaged 10.5 days. Bands now redefined as half-open ``[lo, next_lo)`` so they actually tile the real number line. ``_FREQ_MAX_DAYS = 400`` keeps the upper bound on yearly cadence.

### Tests

- Backend 116 -> 135 (+22 across the three fixes: 3 for daily-net-worth opening balance, 8 for time-range now-anchor, 11 for recurring band gaps).

### Documentation

- ``docs/CALCULATIONS.md`` recurring-detection algorithm section updated to match the actual current implementation: 7 half-open frequency bands (was a stale 6-band closed-interval description from a much older version), correct confidence formula (``max(0, 100 - std*penalty)`` with per-band penalties), note on why bands are half-open.

---

## 2.13.0 - 2026-05-17

UX consolidation pass (#160). Theme: make every "high-level component" interactive in a way that flows the user through the app -- donut click navigates with a category param, destination page filters end-to-end, treemap auto-drills, subcategory analysis preselects the right category. 14 commits.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard donut click routed to non-existent paths.** Click-to-navigate on income/expense donuts used hardcoded strings instead of ``ROUTES`` constants. Routes 404-ed silently when the canonical route changed. Now uses ``ROUTES.INCOME_ANALYSIS`` / ``ROUTES.SPENDING_ANALYSIS``.
- **Donut center text was clipping behind the inner ring.** Long currency strings (``Rs 57,27,353``) overflowed past ``innerRadius``. Switched to ``formatCurrencyShort`` and added an adaptive font size that shrinks for longer strings (22px -> 13px across 6-12 chars). Visual polish: ``innerRadius 60%``, ``outerRadius 85%``, ``paddingAngle 3``, ``cornerRadius 4``.
- **Donut whole-Pie click selected every slice at once.** ``onClick`` was attached to the ``<Pie>`` element and the cursor was ``pointer`` everywhere including the gaps between slices. Each ``<Cell>`` now owns its own ``onClick`` / ``onMouseEnter`` / ``onMouseLeave``. Hover state: active slice brightens 18%, others fade to 40% opacity. Cursor is ``default`` over gaps.

### Added

- **Click-through journey on the dashboard donuts.** Clicking a slice (e.g. "Food & Dining" on the Expense donut) navigates to ``/spending?category=Food%20%26%20Dining``. The destination page reads the URL parameter and applies the filter end-to-end:
  - New ``FilterBanner`` component appears at the top with a "Clear" button
  - MetricCards (Total Spending, Monthly Avg, Top Category, Categories) reflect only the filtered category
  - Pareto Analysis bars + cumulative line filtered
  - Top Merchants section narrowed to merchants in that category
  - Expense Breakdown (treemap) auto-expands to show subcategories of the filtered category
  - Subcategory Deep-Dive opens with the filtered category preselected
  - Same flow on Income Analysis side (``?category=Salary`` etc.)
- **MetricCard becomes opt-in clickable.** New ``href`` and ``onClick`` props turn the card into a ``Link`` or ``button`` with a subtle ``y:-2`` hover lift, stronger border, and a top-right ``ArrowUpRight`` indicator that fades in on hover. Default behavior unchanged when neither prop is set, so all 37 existing callsites are zero-regression.
- **Pareto Analysis chart on Spending Analysis.** Bars sorted by category total, cumulative-percentage line overlaid, 80% reference line marking the Pareto threshold. Helps users see the typical "20% of categories cause 80% of spending" pattern at a glance.
- **Brush slider on more charts.** Drag-to-zoom across the timeline. New shared ``BRUSH_DEFAULTS`` (height 32, traveller width 10, app-blue stroke) used by Net Worth Trend, Investment Analytics Growth Over Time, and Returns Analysis Monthly P&L combo. Default window is the most-recent third so the chart reads at full fidelity on first paint.
- **Spending Patterns insight strip.** Below the Cohort Spending bar chart on Spending Analysis. Two pills: "Peak Day/Date/Month" (shows the bucket name + percent above average) and "Quietest". Removes the need to hover to find the takeaway.
- **Day of Week chart on Year in Review goes radar.** Replaces the flat side-by-side bar chart. Spending and earning overlay each other on a 7-spoke polar grid so weekend-vs-weekday patterns pop visually. Two insight pills below: biggest spending day (with amount) and weekend-vs-weekday delta percent.
- **Year in Review Monthly Breakdown gains a Net cash-flow line.** ``BarChart`` -> ``ComposedChart`` with a dashed blue line overlaying the Spending and Earning bars. Saving months show as peaks; overspending months as troughs. Subtitle clarifies what the chart shows.
- **Auto-granularity on time-series category charts.** ``MultiCategoryTimeAnalysis`` and ``EnhancedSubcategoryAnalysis`` were always daily granularity, which is unreadable past ~3 months. Now auto-buckets day -> week -> month based on the actual data span (90-day, 2-year thresholds). New Auto/Daily/Weekly/Monthly selector lets users override. Header shows the active bucket. Shared helpers (``bucketDate``, ``formatBucketLabel``, ``pickGranularity``) live in ``lib/chartPeriodUtils.ts``.

### Changed

- **Comparison Spending Distribution butterfly chart polish.** Capacity 10 -> 15 categories. Inline value labels on both ends (left for periodA, right for periodB) so users see amounts without hovering. Winner-side opacity boost: the bigger-spend side of each row gets full opacity (0.95), the loser dims to 45% so the eye lands on the larger spender.
- **Holdings Map (Returns Analysis) replaced with horizontal bar chart.** The 2D scatter (transactions vs current value) had weak insight; ranked horizontal bars make winners obvious. Top 12 with overflow footer; top-holding callout in the subtitle.
- **Asset Allocation chart (Investment Analytics) migrated to ``StandardPieChart``.** Gains the same per-slice hover dimming and centre-value polish as the dashboard donuts. Centre shows total invested; header shows asset-class count.

### Removed

- **Monthly Net Worth Change waterfall chart on /net-worth.** Added clutter without unique insight -- the Net Worth Trend chart immediately above already shows month-over-month direction. The chart, the unused ``monthlyChanges`` memo, and ``MonthlyChangesChart.tsx`` are gone.

### Refactored

- **Two ``SummaryCard`` duplicates merged into ``shared/SummaryCard``.** ``bill-calendar/components/SummaryCard.tsx`` and ``subscription-tracker/components/SummaryCard.tsx`` were 95% identical. Single shared component now consumed by both pages.
- **``CategorySparkline`` merged into ``Sparkline`` as a compact variant.** ``CategorySparkline.tsx`` was a thin wrapper that dropped axes and added compact dimensions. Now a ``compact`` prop on the canonical ``Sparkline`` component.

### Tests

- Frontend: 177 vitest tests pass throughout (no regressions).

---

## 2.12.0 - 2026-05-17

Audit batch 2 (#159). Ten small UX/a11y/perf fixes consolidated into one PR.

### Added

- **Dashed reference lines for upcoming Net Worth milestones.** 1L, 5L, 10L, 25L, 50L, 1Cr etc. drawn below the Net Worth trend so users see "I'll cross 1Cr around month X" at a glance. Recharts auto-clips outside the y-axis range so all milestones can be rendered without filtering.
- **Upload CTA on empty states.** Comparison page and Dashboard page empty states now have a clear "Upload Data" action (``EmptyState`` already supported ``actionLabel``/``actionHref``; two visible callsites just hadn't wired them).
- **12-month trend sparkline per row in CategoryBreakdown.** Pure SVG, no chart-lib overhead. Each category row shows its 12-month trajectory inline.
- **Drag-to-zoom Brush below Net Worth chart.** Pre-zoomed to the most-recent third of data on first render. ``StandardAreaChart`` gains an opt-in ``showBrush`` prop for future migrations.
- **Holdings scatter on Returns Analysis.** Activity vs value plot. Pragmatic scope; rigorous CAGR scatter deferred. (Note: subsequently replaced by horizontal bar chart in 2.13.0 -- the scatter axis was confusing in practice.)
- **``LazySection`` wrapper using IntersectionObserver.** Forward-looking helper for below-the-fold lazy mounting. Deferred consumers will land in future PRs.
- **``ChartContainer`` ``ariaLabel`` prop.** Wraps in ``role='img'`` so screen readers get a single descriptive summary instead of walking every SVG path. Improves a11y for analytics pages dramatically.
- **``StaleDataBadge`` component + first consumer in ``InstrumentProjections``.** Tiny amber pill that lights up when a hook lands on compiled-in fallback data (e.g. ``/api/rates/instruments`` is unreachable and the EPF rate comes from the bundled JSON). Users now know when they're seeing fallback values.

### Changed

- **Comparison page: stacked bars collapsed into overlaid bars.** Two-bars-per-metric -> one overlaid bar (faded ghost layer for period A, solid layer for B on top). Reads at a glance instead of forcing the eye to compare two adjacent rectangles.

### Infrastructure

- **GitHub Actions cron** pinging ``/health`` every 30 minutes to keep the Neon free-tier branch unarchived. Eliminates the 20s cold-start the first user of the day was hitting.

---

## 2.11.0 - 2026-05-16

Cleanup + refactor sweep across the codebase. Twelve focused PRs landed in one day.

### Fixed

- **``excluded_accounts`` preference now applied consistently.** Three transaction-query code paths (analytics, calculations, ai_tools) were missing the ``excluded_accounts`` filter so a hidden account could leak into Sankey flows, monthly aggregates, and AI tool responses. Centralized via a shared ``apply_excluded_accounts`` helper on ``build_transaction_query``.

### Added

- **Net Worth projection: 1-stddev confidence band** (#149). Replaced the single dashed projection line (which gave a false impression of certainty) with a band that widens as ``sqrt(time)`` under a geometric Brownian motion model. New ``computeMonthlyGrowthStats`` returns ``{rate, logSigma}`` based on log-return variance over a configurable lookback. New ``projectNetWorthCompoundBand`` paints the band as a Recharts ``<Area>`` with ``[lower, upper]`` tuple values (Recharts paints range areas natively when given a tuple). Median dashed line still renders on top. 7 new unit tests for the math.

### Changed

- **Frontend file-size discipline: every file under 500 LOC** (#141). Big ones split into focused modules. No behaviour change; just easier code review and faster IDE navigation.
- **``SEMANTIC_COLORS`` is canonical for income/expense/savings** (#146). All previously-hardcoded green/red/blue references in analytics components route through the design tokens.
- **Status semantic palette wired as Tailwind tokens** (#147). ``bg-app-green``, ``text-app-red``, etc. resolved via the design tokens instead of arbitrary hex strings.
- **Expense category colors centralized** (#145). ``EXPENSE_CATEGORY_COLORS`` is the single source; consumed by treemaps, donuts, and bar charts.
- **KPI typography standardized** (#148). MetricCard, KpiCard, StatCard, and SummaryCard all use the same type-scale tokens for value, label, and subtitle.

### Removed

- **In-memory token blacklist** (#139). Was a no-op on Vercel multi-worker deploys (each worker has its own dict, so a "logged-out" token is still valid on every other worker). Logout now just relies on the frontend dropping the token. Real token revocation needs a shared store (Redis) and is a future-PR if SSO ever requires it.

### Documentation

- **README overhaul + version sync** (#142). README badges, examples, and architecture sections reorganized; versions synced to the prevailing 2.10.0 across CHANGELOG, package.json, and pyproject.toml.
- **Post-2.10.0 cleanup pass** (#144). Doc drift fixes uncovered while reading the 2.10.0 audit notes.

### Internal / tooling (no user impact)

- ``indian-finance-expert`` skill converted to CSV-backed lookups (#143).
- 8 project-level Claude skills + ``.claude`` config committed (#137).
- Codebase-atlas skills + task-skills consolidation (#139, mixed with the token-blacklist removal).

---

## 2.10.0 - 2026-05-13

Hardcoded-values audit. Fixes silently-wrong defaults, reduces classifier brittleness, and centralizes policy constants that were scattered across the codebase. Two full rescan passes; every finding either fixed, deliberately skipped with reason, or tracked for a follow-up PR that needs a schema migration.

### Fixed

- **Convenience spending bug: `calculate_convenience_spending()` was returning 0 for every user.** The lowercase-token list (`{shopping, dining, food, ...}`) was compared via exact equality against normalized category names (`"Food & Dining"`, `"Entertainment & Recreations"`), so it never matched. The "Significant Convenience Spending" insight has never fired in production. Switched to substring match; dropped `food` (over-matched essentials), added `recreation`, `leisure`, `travel`, `subscription`. `core/calculator.py`.
- **Recurring detection dead zones.** Frequency bands had gaps at 19d, 46-49d, 76-79d, 111-149d, 211-339d -- any subscription with those cycles was silently invisible to the detector. Bands are now contiguous (each starts at previous_end + 1): WEEKLY 4-10, BIWEEKLY 11-19, MONTHLY 20-49, BIMONTHLY 50-79, QUARTERLY 80-129, SEMIANNUAL 130-269, YEARLY 270-400. `core/analytics/recurring.py`.
- **Merchant regex missed most real UPI narrations.** `^Swiggy` only matched when the merchant name was the first token; `"UPI/Swiggy/ref123"` and `"Payment to Zomato"` never hit the merchant list. Switched to `\b(...)\b` with `pattern.search()`. `core/analytics/merchants.py`.
- **Bank-name normalizer covered only 5 banks with case-sensitive exact match.** `"SBI Bank"` (correctly cased) didn't normalize because the lookup key was lowercase-only. Rewritten as case-insensitive word-boundary regex covering 20+ banks (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Axis, Kotak, Yes, IDFC First, IndusInd, PNB, BOB, BOI, Canara, Union, Federal, RBL, IDBI, Citi, HSBC, Standard Chartered, DBS, AU Small Finance). Longest-match-first so `"IDFC First"` beats `"IDFC"`. Does not match `"axis"` inside `"taxis"`. `ingest/normalizer.py`.
- **Default investment-account mappings leaked the maintainer's personal account names** (`"Grow Stocks"`, `"IND money"`, `"RSUs"`, `"FD/Bonds"`) into every install. Shipped empty -- users configure their own mappings via Settings > Account Classifications. `core/_analytics_helpers.py`.
- **Frontend account-type classifier was substring-matching without case folding and collision-prone.** `"DEMAT"` (uppercase) didn't match, `"ICICI Investment"` matched both `invest` and `bank` with undefined ordering. Rewritten with priority-ordered rules (credit_card → investment → loan → deposit), word-boundary regex, case-insensitive. New `credit_card` type distinguishes `"HDFC CC"` → credit_card from `"HDFC Bank"` → deposit from `"HDFC Stocks"` → investment. `constants/accountTypes.ts` with 41 new unit tests.
- **Fallback exchange rates were stale by >1 month.** Refreshed all 14 currency pairs to 2026-05-13 values. Response now includes `fallback_as_of` so the frontend can warn users when they're seeing fallback data. `api/exchange_rates.py`.
- **EPF default rate was ~3 years out of date** (8.15% labelled "FY 2023-24" in a 2026 codebase). Bumped to 8.25% (FY 2024-25 notification) and sourced from the new backend config.

### Added

- **`/api/rates/instruments` endpoint** serving EPF/PPF/NPS rates from `backend/src/ledger_sync/config/instrument_rates.json` with `effective_from`, `effective_until`, `source_url`, and free-text `notes` per instrument. There is no reliable public JSON API for Indian EPF/PPF rates (EPFO publishes via PDF notification yearly, Ministry of Finance publishes PPF quarterly via press release), so this file is the source of truth -- updating a rate is a one-line PR. `api/rates.py` + `config/instrument_rates.json`.
- **`useInstrumentRates()` hook** on the frontend with a compiled-in fallback so `InstrumentProjections` renders zero-network before the query resolves. `hooks/api/useInstrumentRates.ts` + `services/api/rates.ts`.
- **Rate limiting** (`slowapi`) on `/api/upload` (10/minute) and `/api/ai/bedrock/chat` (30/minute). `auth.py` and `oauth.py` already had limiters; these were the remaining sensitive endpoints without protection.
- **Database pool settings are now env-configurable** via `LEDGER_SYNC_DB_POOL_SIZE`, `LEDGER_SYNC_DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `LEDGER_SYNC_DB_POOL_RECYCLE_SECONDS`, `LEDGER_SYNC_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `LEDGER_SYNC_DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `LEDGER_SYNC_DB_IDLE_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Defaults unchanged (5/3/300/10/30/60) and sized for Neon free tier. Production tuning no longer requires a code edit.
- **`LEDGER_SYNC_AI_MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` setting** to reconcile the frontend `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=6` runaway-loop cap with the backend `UsageLogRequest.tool_rounds` max=20 reporting limit. Single documented source.

### Changed

- **Tax calculator refactored to a dated-config layout.** All year-specific rules (slabs, surcharge bands, 87A rebate, standard deduction, cess, professional tax) now live in `frontend/src/lib/tax-config/index.ts` as per-FY blocks (FY 2023-24, 2024-25, 2025-26) with `source` field referencing the Budget notification. `getTaxConfig(fyStartYear)` resolves the config with graceful fallback (newest known for future years, oldest known for ancient years). `taxCalculator.ts` is unchanged at the public API level -- every exported symbol (slab arrays, `calculateTax`, `getStandardDeduction`, `getTaxSlabs`) still works, but sources its constants from the config loader. Adding Budget 2026 when it lands is a single new entry in `tax-config/index.ts`.
- **Insight thresholds given names.** 10 magic numbers in `core/insights.py` (`40` / `80` consistency cutoffs, `40%` category concentration, `30%` convenience, `1.2` / `0.8` trend ratios, `20%` / `-10%` lifestyle inflation, `1.3` / `0.7` velocity) extracted to module-level named constants with a header comment explaining they are heuristics, not policy. Zero behavior change; makes future tuning discoverable.
- **Health-score rubric centralized.** `HEALTH_SCORE_RUBRIC` const in `healthScoreUtils.ts` holds the 8 primary targets (savings 20%, essential 50%, emergency 6mo, investment 15%, DTI ≤36%, savings consistency 90%, income CV ≤25%) and is referenced by `scoreSpendLessThanIncome`, `scoreEssentialRatio`, `scoreEmergencyFund`, `scoreInvestment`, `scoreDebtToIncome`, `scoreSavingsConsistency`, `scoreIncomeStability`. Score-curve math unchanged -- pure refactor.
- **AI tool default limits centralized.** Replaced six scattered literals (`20` / `100` for `search_transactions`, `15` / `50` for `list_categories`, `6` / `24` for `list_recent_months`) with named module-level constants in `api/ai_tools.py`. The executor clamp and the JSON Schema shown to the LLM now read from the same source -- no more drift risk between the two.
- **Fallback exchange-rate response shape:** now includes `fallback_as_of` for frontend staleness banner.

### Tests

- **Frontend test count 123 -> 170** (+47). 41 new cases in `constants/__tests__/accountTypes.test.ts` covering CC-vs-bank priority, word boundaries, ambiguous names, case insensitivity, edge cases. 6 new cases in `lib/tax-config/__tests__/taxConfig.test.ts` covering FY lookup, future-year fallback, ancient-year fallback, cess/prof-tax stability across FYs.
- **Backend test count 93 -> 98** (+5). 4 new bank-name normalizer tests covering case insensitivity, extended bank coverage, longest-match-first, word boundaries (`"axis"` inside `"taxis"` must not match). 1 new test on the `/api/rates/instruments` endpoint.

### Skipped (follow-up PRs; each needs a DB migration or changes equality semantics)

- FIRE/NPS assumption persistence, per-state professional tax, user-defined category aliases, always-title-case categories, transfer amount-tolerance pairing, user-tunable insight thresholds, AI pricing-table freshness automation.

## 2.9.0 - 2026-04-29

Follow-up to 2.8.0's audit-driven cleanup: execute the remaining feature gaps that were flagged and delete the Insights page outright.

### Removed

- **Insights page deleted entirely.** The 2.8.0 audit already trimmed it to 3 widgets; user feedback confirmed the whole page was cruft. The route (`/insights`), sidebar + CommandPalette + MorePage entries, `ROUTES.INSIGHTS`, and the remaining three components (`IncomeStabilityIndex`, `LifestyleCreepDetection`, `SavingsMilestonesTimeline`) all gone. The dashboard, comparison, and individual analytics pages cover these insights natively -- there's no single "Insights" page anymore.

### Added

- **Barista FIRE variant** on the FIRE Calculator. New `computeBaristaFIRE()` helper and a monthly-income slider. Shows how much smaller your corpus needs to be when a part-time income covers some of your expenses (soft landing rather than cold stop). Layout bumped from 3 variant cards to 4 (Lean / Barista / Standard / Fat).
- **Portfolio-level XIRR** metric on the Investment Analytics page. New shared `frontend/src/lib/xirr.ts` helper (extracted from the per-account implementation on the MF projection page, now DRY). Builds cashflows from every investment transfer plus the current total value as a final liquidation event, then solves via Newton-Raphson. Shows `-` when fewer than one dated flow exists or solver diverges.
- **Subscription Tracker: "Saved per month" KPI** showing estimated monthly savings from deactivated recurring expense items (cancelled subs, paid-off EMIs, stopped gyms). Only appears once the user has at least one deactivated expense item.
- **"Tune detection" link** from the Anomaly Review page header to Settings, making the existing sensitivity / threshold / anomaly-type preferences discoverable.

### Changed

- **Comparison page default is now FY-over-FY, not month-over-month.** FY is the cadence that drives tax + saving-rate decisions; month-over-month is dominated by one-off rent / bonus / travel noise.
- **Comparison FY mode truncates both sides to the elapsed-day count when the selected period is the current (in-progress) FY.** Prevents the "last FY ₹24L vs this FY ₹4L = 83 % down!" artifact that appeared when the current FY was only two months in. Labels now read `FY24-25 (to same date)` vs `FY25-26 (YTD)` to make the truncation explicit.
- **GST Analysis disclaimer rewritten** to be more explicit about what the numbers represent ("approximate only -- GST isn't line-itemed in bank statements, use for lifestyle-scale awareness, not for filing") and coloured warning-orange instead of info-blue so users don't mistake estimates for precision.
- **XIRR implementation extracted to `frontend/src/lib/xirr.ts`** and consumed by both the MF projection page and the new Investment Analytics XIRR metric. Signature-identical to what was already in the MF projection file; now unit-tested.

### Tests

- **Frontend test count 114 -> 123.** 5 new tests for `computeBaristaFIRE` (zero / partial / full-coverage / zero-SWR edge cases), 4 for `calculateXIRR` (empty, two-flow 10 %, monthly-SIP, divergent same-sign), updated the `computeFIRE` orchestrator test to cover the new `baristaFIRE` field.

---

## 2.8.0 - 2026-04-29

Audit-driven cleanup and accuracy pass. Comes out of `docs/AUDIT.md` which rated every page, chart, and calculation against the gold-standard personal-finance feature set.

### Removed

- **8 underperforming / dead analytics components** (~1 400 lines total) all in `frontend/src/components/analytics/`:
  - Dead code: `SubcategoryAnalysis.tsx` (superseded by `EnhancedSubcategoryAnalysis`), `YearOverYearComparison.tsx` (never consumed).
  - Retired from the Insights page: `SpendingVelocityGauge` (gauges are wrong for continuous metrics), `PeerComparisonBenchmarks` (invented peer data), `CategoryCorrelationAnalysis` (correlation numbers without actionable next step), `AccountActivityScore` (paired with the correlation widget - niche), `MonthlyFinancialReportCard` (duplicated Year-in-Review), `ExpenseElasticityChart` (duplicated lifestyle-creep signal).

### Changed

- **Insights page trimmed from 9 widgets to 3 strong ones** -- `IncomeStabilityIndex`, `LifestyleCreepDetection`, `SavingsMilestonesTimeline`. Each drives a specific decision: "how predictable is my cash flow", "is my spending quietly growing faster than income", "what big milestones have I hit / am I nearing".
- **Net worth projection math fixed: linear regression -> compound (geometric)**. Savings and asset returns both compound, so the old linear model dramatically underestimated time-to-target. A user with ₹50L at 12 % annualized reaches ₹1Cr in ~6 years by compound, but ~17 years by linear extrapolation -- the UI now shows the realistic number. New helpers `computeMonthlyGrowthRate`, `projectNetWorthCompound`, and `buildMilestoneRowsCompound` use geometric mean over the last 12 monthly data points. Old linear helpers kept for backwards compatibility.
- **Milestone summary bar now shows annualized %** instead of an absolute monthly rupee delta (the delta number was meaningless once the rate is compound). Hover tooltip still shows the approximate rupee gain at the current net worth.
- **Dashboard default widget count reduced from 14 to 6** on first visit. Power users can still turn on the other 8 from Settings > Dashboard Widgets. New default set: Savings Rate, Top Spending, Top Income, Burn Rate, Daily Spending, Biggest Transaction.

### Added

- **Section 80CCD(1B) deduction input** in Tax Planning's regime-comparison form. Lets users claim the standalone ₹50 000 NPS Tier-1 deduction that sits over and above the 80C ₹1.5L cap -- a common miss for salaried NPS contributors.
- **Advance Tax Schedule panel** on the Tax Planning page showing the four Indian deadlines (15 Jun / 15 Sep / 15 Dec / 15 Mar) with cumulative percentages (15 / 45 / 75 / 100) and amounts due based on the projected annual liability. Current-FY deadlines within 30 days are highlighted to dodge penalty interest under Sections 234B / 234C. Hidden when total tax is zero.

### Tests

- **10 new tests** for the compound-growth helpers in `netWorthProjection.test.ts`: edge cases (empty / single-point / zero / negative start), geometric-mean recovery against a synthetic 4 %/month series, compound-vs-linear horizon comparison, and compound milestone ETA solver accuracy. Frontend test count 104 -> 114.

---

## 2.7.1 - 2026-04-29

Polish patch -- Settings UX cleanup and a smarter auto-classifier, plus a new data-focused page catalog.

### Changed

- **Settings sections are collapsed by default.** The `Section` primitive (`frontend/src/pages/settings/sectionPrimitives.tsx`) now defaults `defaultCollapsed` to `true`, so opening Settings shows a scannable list of headers instead of a wall of forms. Dropped the per-mode override on `AIAssistantSection` (was auto-expanding when the user was configured) and the redundant `defaultCollapsed={true}` on `AdvancedSection` so every section has a uniform baseline.
- **Auto-account classification now studies balance data, not just account names.** `getDefaultClassifications` in `frontend/src/pages/settings/helpers.ts` gained an optional `accountStats` argument and applies a balance-sign refinement pass to anything the keyword dictionary couldn't classify: negative balance + activity -> **Credit Cards**, positive balance + >=3 transactions -> **Bank Accounts**. User-saved classifications still win. Keyword list also extended with Indian card brands the old dictionary missed (Jupiter Edge, OneCard, Slice, Millennia, SimplyCLICK, Regalia, Swiggy HDFC, Amazon Pay ICICI, Flipkart Axis, Amex, Diners) and `jupiter` (neobank).

### Added

- **`docs/PAGES.md`** -- new data-focused catalog documenting every page in the app: what each one shows, the tables/endpoints it reads from, the decisions it helps the user make. Written for "what can I learn from this app?" rather than "how is this built?".

---

## 2.7.0 - 2026-04-29

Mobile PWA polish landed in three stacked PRs (#126 / #127 / #128). The app now installs on iPhone/Android home screens like a native-feeling finance app, with a bottom tab bar for phone-sized viewports and a full-bleed app icon.

### Added

- **Bottom tab bar** for phone viewports (`<lg` breakpoint). `Home / Txns / Flow / More` with a Framer-Motion shared-element active pill and 52px touch targets. Hidden on desktop (sidebar stays).
- **`/more` route + `MorePage.tsx`** -- grid menu grouping every route that didn't earn a tab slot (Analytics, Investments, Planning, Tax, Data) + sign-out.
- **Full-bleed PWA app icon** -- uses the same PiggyBank glyph on the blue-to-indigo gradient as the web header. `pwa-assets.config.ts` overrides `minimal-2023`'s apple-touch transform to `padding: 0` + transparent background so the gradient paints edge-to-edge; iOS applies its own squircle mask on install. No more white-ring "unfinished-app" look on the home screen.

### Changed

- **`h-screen` -> `h-dvh`** in `AppLayout` and `Sidebar` so the viewport tracks the dynamic-viewport-height API. No more content jumping when the mobile address bar toggles.
- **Safe-area insets wired through** the sticky `PageHeader`, chat widget / panel, and `HomePage` header. Sticky headers bake `env(safe-area-inset-top)` into padding so titles don't render behind the iOS notch in standalone mode. Main content gets `pb-safe` so the last row clears the home indicator. `ChatWidget` respects `safe-area-inset-right` for landscape on notched devices.
- **`theme-color` aligned to `#000000`** (was `#09090b`) in both `index.html` and the PWA manifest so the status bar blends into the app black -- no seam at the top.
- **Body/HTML reset** in `index.css`: `margin: 0`, `padding: 0`, `overscroll-behavior-y: none`, `html { height: 100% }`, `#root { height: 100% }` so `h-dvh` has a reference and rubber-band scroll doesn't flash white behind the notch.
- **`CreditCardHealth` widget now uses the user's account classifications** instead of substring-grepping `"credit"` in account names. Cards like "HDFC Millennia" or "Amazon Pay Card" were silently dropped before. Falls back to the old name match only when an account has no classification yet.

### Fixed

- **HomePage layout shifted up behind the notch in PWA standalone mode.** The landing page lives outside `AppLayout` so the safe-area work from the other PRs didn't reach it. Header padding-top/left/right now use `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; main's `pt-20` becomes `calc(5rem + inset-top)`; footer gets `inset-bottom`. `h-screen` -> `min-h-dvh` matches the rest of the app.

---

## 2.5.0 - 2026-04-26

Major AI chat upgrade: the bot can now answer questions about *any* of your data, not just the six fields we pre-loaded into the system prompt.

### Changed

- **AI chat now uses tool calling instead of context stuffing.** Previously `buildFinancialContext` fetched six endpoints up front and crammed them into the system prompt; anything outside that fixed slice ("when did I last go for a haircut?", "how many bank accounts?") was unanswerable. The model now has nine read-only tools it can call on demand -- `list_accounts`, `search_transactions`, `get_monthly_summary`, `list_categories`, `get_category_spending`, `get_net_worth`, `list_recurring`, `list_goals`, `list_recent_months` -- and picks the right one based on the question. Same tool schema works across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Bedrock (each provider has a native tool-calling API).
- **System prompt shrunk to ~10 lines.** Just preferences (currency, fiscal year), today's date, tool-usage guidance, and an anti-hallucination nudge. The bot reaches for tools instead of making up plausible numbers.
- **All three providers are now non-streaming.** Tool-calling requires handling `tool_use` events between turns, which makes SSE streaming awkward. Plain JSON for all providers keeps the tool loop simple (one HTTP call per round). Users see "processing... 2-5s... full reply" instead of token-by-token streaming.

### Added

- **`backend/src/ledger_sync/api/ai_tools.py`** -- tool registry + `/api/ai/tools` (list) + `/api/ai/tools/execute` (run). Every tool is user-scoped via `CurrentUser`, enforced at the FastAPI dependency level so the LLM can never see another user's data.
- **`search_transactions` tool** -- full-text search over transaction notes/category/subcategory/account with optional date, category, account, type, and amount filters. Capped at 100 results to prevent runaway queries.
- **Frontend tool-calling loop in `useChat`.** Sends -> receives `tool_use` -> executes tools in parallel -> appends `tool_result` -> sends again -> repeats until `end_turn` or 6-round limit (prevents runaway loops).
- **16 new tests:** 7 for `/api/ai/bedrock/chat` covering the new block-based message shape (`tool_use`/`tool_result` round-trip, `toolConfig` forwarding), 9 for `/api/ai/tools` covering every tool against a real SQLite DB with seeded data. Backend test count 75 -> 91.
- **6 rewritten frontend tests** for `chatAdapters.ts` covering OpenAI/Anthropic/Bedrock request + response mapping including tool-call conversion.

### Why tool calling over a vector database (RAG)

Finance data is structured. `SELECT category, SUM(amount) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = ? AND date >= ?` beats any embedding similarity search when the question is a database query in disguise. Vector DBs are worth adding later for semantic merchant matching ("food delivery", "subscriptions I don't use") but are overkill for 90% of finance questions.

---

## 2.6.0 - 2026-04-27

Follow-up to 2.5.0's tool-calling chat. Biggest change: the chat now has a **two-mode split** so users can either use the app's shared Bedrock key (free, rate-limited) or bring their own API key (unlimited, they pay). Plus six new tools expose tax / FY / cash-flow / budget data to the assistant, and every LLM round-trip is now logged for cost transparency.

### Added -- App vs BYOK mode split

- **`ai_mode` column** on `user_preferences` (`'app_bedrock'` default or `'byok'`) + `PATCH /api/preferences/ai-config/mode` to toggle.
- **App mode (default):** new users get a working chatbot immediately. No provider picker, no key input -- the server uses the app's shared Bedrock bearer token and a fixed cheap default model (`us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`). Rate-limited to `LEDGER_SYNC_AI_DAILY_MESSAGE_LIMIT` messages per day (default 10) so our AWS bill stays predictable. Users who hit the cap get a clear 429 with a "switch to BYOK" pointer.
- **BYOK mode:** existing provider/model/key picker + per-user token limits. Users pay their own provider. No app-level cap (the provider bills them directly).
- **`settings.py`** gains three new env-overridable fields: `ai_default_bedrock_model`, `ai_default_bedrock_region`, `ai_daily_message_limit`.
- **Settings → AI Assistant** rebuilt with a stacked two-card mode picker. App-mode panel shows a live "3 / 10 left" counter with a small explainer. BYOK-mode panel unchanged from 2.5.0 (provider/model/key + optional token limits).
- **ChatPanel usage badge** is now mode-aware: `"· 3 / 10 left"` in app mode (messages), `"· 1.2k / 50k"` in BYOK mode (tokens).
- **ChatWidget gating:** opening the chat no longer requires `has_key` when the user is in app mode -- they can chat out of the box.

### Added -- 6 new AI tools (registry now 15)

- `get_fy_summary` -- fiscal-year rollup (income by source, tax paid, savings, YoY change) from the `fy_summaries` table.
- `get_tax_summary` -- prefers uploaded `TaxRecord` filings (gross/TDS/advance/self-assessment/80C/80D/standard deductions) and falls back to transaction-derived totals when no filing is available.
- `get_cash_flow` -- monthly income-vs-expense time series with totals and averages.
- `list_budgets` -- active budgets with current-month usage %, ranked by usage.
- `list_anomalies` -- recent unusual-spending alerts the system detected.
- `get_preferences_summary` -- currency, fiscal-year start, and salary-structure components so the LLM can reason about context.

### Added -- Usage tracking

- **`ai_usage_log` table** with `(provider, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, tool_rounds, cost_usd, timestamp)`. Bedrock usage is recorded server-side after `converse()`; OpenAI and Anthropic report back from the browser via `POST /api/ai/usage/log`.
- **Cost estimation** via `core/ai_pricing.py` -- per-provider, per-model-prefix USD-per-1M-token table with longest-prefix match. Unknown models fall through to a conservative 10/40 USD-per-1M fallback so we never under-report cost.
- **`GET /api/ai/usage`** returns today / MTD / all-time rollups + current limits + today's message count (for app mode). Used by Settings and the chat header.
- **BYOK per-user token limits:** two nullable columns `ai_daily_token_limit` / `ai_monthly_token_limit` plus `PATCH /api/preferences/ai-config/limits`. Applies only in BYOK mode; app mode uses the server-wide message cap instead.

### Changed

- **System prompt stays minimal.** The LLM fetches data via tools instead of having summaries pre-stuffed. ~300 tokens per round instead of ~2K.
- **Default mode is `app_bedrock`.** Existing users stay in their previous configuration (the migration sets `app_bedrock` as the server-default, but the save-config endpoint now flips prefs to `byok` whenever someone configures a provider key, so migrating users who already had BYOK remain BYOK after their next save).

### Migrations

- **`20260427_1200_add_ai_usage_log_and_token_limits.py`** creates the `ai_usage_log` table + two indexes, adds `ai_daily_token_limit` + `ai_monthly_token_limit` to `user_preferences`, and adds the `ai_mode` column (default `'app_bedrock'`). Downgrade is intentionally empty per project convention.

### Tests

- **Backend:** 32 new tests across 3 suites (`test_ai_tools.py`, `test_ai_usage.py`, `test_ai_chat.py` extensions). Coverage of the 6 new tools, usage rollups, cost estimation edge cases, app-mode message cap enforcement, BYOK bypass of the app cap, and default-model selection. Test count 75 → 107.

### Deploy notes

- Run `uv run alembic upgrade head` once after deploy (auto-runs on Vercel via the migrate workflow).
- No new required env vars. Optional overrides: `LEDGER_SYNC_AI_DAILY_MESSAGE_LIMIT` (default 10), `LEDGER_SYNC_AI_DEFAULT_BEDROCK_MODEL` (default Haiku), `LEDGER_SYNC_AI_DEFAULT_BEDROCK_REGION` (default `us-east-1`).

---

## 2.4.2 - 2026-04-25

Further mobile polish after device testing, plus an AI chat fix.

### Changed

- **PWA icon redesigned.** The old mark had the L-glyph in the top-left corner leaving dead space bottom-right, and read as "a bar chart" at 64px. New icon is a centered bold rupee (₹) glyph over a subtle ascending trend line on the blue-to-indigo gradient. Reads clearly at 64px home-screen badge size, stays recognisable after Android's maskable crop, and ties the mark to the product (personal finance) rather than a generic chart. Regenerated all 6 PNG sizes from [pwa-icon-source.svg](frontend/public/pwa-icon-source.svg).
- **Cash Flow on mobile is now a dedicated vertical view, not a shrunken Sankey.** Phones get [MobileFlowView](frontend/src/pages/income-expense-flow/components/MobileFlowView.tsx) -- a stacked sequence (Income sources -> Total Income -> Savings + Expenses split -> Expense categories) with proportional bars and currency-accurate labels. No swipe, no cramped nodes, no horizontal scroll. Desktop still gets the full Sankey.
- **Bedrock chat path switched from SSE streaming to plain JSON.** The backend runs on Vercel via Mangum, which buffers streaming responses end-to-end, so the old `StreamingResponse` made the UI sit on "processing" forever -- the browser only saw the first byte once boto3's `converse_stream` generator had fully drained (or the function timed out). Now the backend calls `converse` (non-streaming), collects the full reply, and returns `{ "content": "..." }`. The frontend [Bedrock adapter](frontend/src/lib/chatAdapters.ts) fetches once, parses JSON, emits the full text as a single token. Anthropic and OpenAI paths still stream browser-direct since they don't go through Mangum.

### Fixed

- **Chart heights auto-cap at 280px on mobile** via a new `MOBILE_HEIGHT_CAP` in [ChartContainer](frontend/src/components/ui/ChartContainer.tsx). Previously a chart with `height={400}` would eat ~60% of a 667px iPhone viewport. Now any numeric height greater than 280 is auto-shrunk on `max-width: 639px`; percent heights (`'100%'`) and the new optional `mobileHeight` prop still win. Affects ~20 chart call-sites with one change.
- **Numeric columns in DataTable now use `tabular-nums`.** Right-aligned cells align digit-by-digit vertically, which matters most on mobile where rows are tight.
- **CommandPalette (Cmd+K) on mobile** -- panel no longer pushed off-screen by the on-screen keyboard. Top offset drops from `15vh` to `8vh` below `sm`, panel is `flex flex-col max-h-[80vh]` so the input stays visible while results scroll inside.
- **AI chat "processing... forever" with no error surfaced.** Silent `{"error": "..."}` SSE events from the Bedrock proxy were dropped by the token extractor (it only looked for `{"token": "..."}`), so invalid model IDs, auth failures, region mismatches, and timeouts all looked identical to the user: a spinner that never resolved. With the new JSON path, Bedrock errors surface as HTTP 502 with a readable `detail`; the existing `onError` path displays them in the chat UI.
- **AI model selection now has a "Custom model ID" free-text field.** The hardcoded Bedrock model list can get stale the moment AWS ships a new inference profile; a user who picked "Claude Opus 4.7 (Bedrock)" was sending `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7-v1` which Bedrock no longer accepts. The dropdown now includes "Custom model ID..." which enables a text input below so the exact `modelId` (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0`) can be pasted straight from the Bedrock console -- no code update required. Also shown/editable when a saved value doesn't match any dropdown option, so users migrating from stale IDs can see and fix them.
- **Bedrock auth via bearer token (`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`).** The server-side proxy used `boto3.client("bedrock-runtime").converse(...)` expecting SigV4 credentials, but production was running with only a Bedrock API key. boto3 1.39+ auto-detects `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, so the existing code works once the env var is in place. Added a [`LEDGER_SYNC_BEDROCK_API_KEY`](backend/src/ledger_sync/config/settings.py) setting that gets injected into `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` on startup, so all app secrets stay under the `LEDGER_SYNC_` prefix on Vercel. Added a pre-flight check that returns HTTP 503 with a clear "server not configured" message when no auth mechanism is present -- before, boto3's error surfaced as the misleading "model identifier is invalid".
- **AI chat had zero financial context despite `buildFinancialContext`.** The context builder expected flat response shapes like `summary.income` as a number, but every V2 endpoint returns `{ data: [...], count: N }` with **nested** objects (`summary.income.total`). Every section's `Array.isArray && length > 0` guard silently skipped, `Promise.allSettled` swallowed fetch errors, and the chat shipped with an empty system prompt -- which is why the assistant replied "I don't have access to your financial data." Rewrote [chatContext.ts](frontend/src/lib/chatContext.ts) to match the actual V2 response shapes (monthly-summaries, category-breakdown `{ categories, total }`, recurring, net-worth `current`, goals) and log failures with `console.warn` so future endpoint shape changes don't silently return an empty prompt.

### New

- **5 unit tests for the Bedrock chat endpoint** ([test_ai_chat.py](backend/tests/unit/test_ai_chat.py)): no-preferences, wrong-provider, missing-AWS-auth, successful converse, boto3-exception handling. Uses `StaticPool` + `check_same_thread=False` so `TestClient` (httpx worker thread) can reuse the in-memory SQLite DB.
- **Live Bedrock smoke-test script** ([backend/scripts/bedrock_smoke_test.py](backend/scripts/bedrock_smoke_test.py)): runs `converse()` against a real model to verify the bearer-token path end-to-end. Kept out of the pytest suite because CI has no AWS access; invoked with `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=... uv run python scripts/bedrock_smoke_test.py`.
- **Shared `useIsMobile` hook** extracted to [hooks/useIsMobile.ts](frontend/src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts) from the inline definition in `IncomeExpenseFlowPage`.

---

## 2.4.1 - 2026-04-25

Follow-up mobile-UX pass after installing the 2.4.0 PWA on iPhone and finding real-device issues.

### Fixed

- **iOS Safari auto-zoom on input focus.** Every input with `font-size < 16px` (all of them -- default was `text-sm` = 14px) triggered a viewport zoom on tap, which then failed to zoom back out. Now any input/select/textarea on viewports below the `sm` breakpoint (640px) renders at 16px. Desktop typography is unchanged. Single global rule in [frontend/src/index.css](frontend/src/index.css).
- **PWA content hidden under the iPhone notch.** Added `viewport-fit=cover` to [index.html](frontend/index.html) and safe-area-inset utility classes (`pt-safe`, `pb-safe`, etc.) to index.css. The sidebar hamburger button and chat widget now offset themselves by `env(safe-area-inset-top)` / `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` so they clear the notch and home indicator in standalone PWA mode.
- **Hamburger button overlapping page titles.** The `lg:hidden` hamburger at `fixed top-4 left-4` was sitting directly over every page's `<h1>`. [PageHeader](frontend/src/components/ui/PageHeader.tsx) now adds `px-12 text-center` on mobile (reserves 48px for the hamburger on each side and centers the title) and reverts to `px-0 text-left` at `sm+`. Affects all 22 pages that use `PageHeader`.
- **ChatPanel overflowing 375px viewport.** Hardcoded `w-[380px]` caused horizontal scroll on iPhone SE. Now `w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] max-w-[380px]` and `max-h-[70vh] sm:max-h-[500px]` in [ChatPanel.tsx](frontend/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx).
- **Below-minimum touch targets (< 44px).** Grew the sidebar bottom-bar icons, chat-panel header buttons, and profile-modal close button from 32-36px to 44px on mobile, keeping the desktop dimensions via `sm:` resets. Apple HIG minimum is 44x44 px.
- **Numeric inputs showing full alphabetic keyboard on mobile.** Added `inputMode="decimal"` to 31 currency/percentage inputs across 14 files (budget forms, goals, settings, tax deductions, mutual fund projections, etc.). Mobile users now see a decimal-optimized keypad.
- **DataTable horizontal scroll invisible on mobile.** Existing 4px scrollbar was invisible on touch devices. The scroll wrapper now shows a thin scrollbar on viewports below `sm` and uses `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` + `overscroll-behavior-x: contain` for smooth momentum scroll without rubber-banding the outer page.

---

## 2.4.0 - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **PWA support** (#80) -- Ledger Sync is now installable on iOS, Android, and desktop. Closes #80.
  - Web App Manifest with `display: standalone`, dark theme color (`#09090b`), portrait orientation, and 4 icon sizes (64, 192, 512, maskable 512). Manifest `start_url` and `scope` are relative so they resolve correctly under the `/ledger-sync/` GitHub Pages base path.
  - Service worker via `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox under the hood) with `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` -- updates propagate within one app restart. Precaches the entire app shell (JS/CSS/HTML/fonts/icons, ~2.4 MiB across 68 entries) so the UI loads instantly offline.
  - **Financial data is intentionally NOT cached.** The service worker explicitly denies `/api/*` via `navigateFallbackDenylist` -- API calls always hit the network, so account balances and analytics are never stale. TanStack Query's existing error-state handling covers the offline-with-data case.
  - iOS/Android install meta tags: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style=black-translucent`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, and a 180x180 apple-touch-icon.
  - Icon source committed as [frontend/public/pwa-icon-source.svg](frontend/public/pwa-icon-source.svg). Regenerate with `pnpm run generate:icons` (uses `@vite-pwa/assets-generator` + sharp).

---

## 2.3.2 - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Earning-start-date is now a view filter, not a data filter.** Previously, toggling "Use as analytics start" silently dropped pre-earning-start transactions from every backend query, which corrupted factual totals: Net Worth dropped (because pre-earning balance-affecting transactions vanished), account balances shrank, and historical milestone crossings disappeared. Earning-start is now applied only at the chart x-axis layer via `useAnalyticsTimeFilter`; all underlying data (account balances, totals, milestone history) is always computed from the user's full transaction history.
  - Backend: `build_transaction_query(apply_earning_start=True)` default flipped to `False`. `_apply_date_range` in `transactions.py` no longer accepts a `user` parameter. Three analytics_v2 endpoints (`/monthly-summaries`, `/daily-summaries`, `/category-trends`) no longer clamp their period by earning-start. The `_get_earning_start_period` helper is removed (dead code).
  - Frontend: `useTransactions` hook no longer filters by earning-start-date. `useAnalyticsTimeFilter` now applies earning-start to `dateRange.start_date` (the chart-window lower bound) via a new `clampStartToEarningStart` helper with unit tests. Net Worth milestones scan the full unfiltered history, so "First Reached" dates from before earning-start remain visible.
  - 8 new unit tests (7 for `clampStartToEarningStart`, 1 regression for milestone preservation).

## 2.3.1 - 2026-04-25

Milestones table redesigned around the question users actually ask: "have I *held* this threshold, or just touched it once?"

### Changed

- **[Milestones table](frontend/src/pages/net-worth/components/MilestonesTable.tsx) columns simplified to 5:** Target | Status | First Reached | Stable Since | Expected to Reach. Dropped the separate Amount column (now shown as a subline under the Target label) and the Notes column (replaced by structured date columns).
- **Status now has 3 states** instead of 2:
  - **Stable** (green ✓) -- crossed the threshold and never dipped below since.
  - **Reached** (yellow ○) -- crossed once but later dipped below; still achieved, not stable.
  - **Upcoming** (muted ⊙) -- not yet crossed.
- **Header stats** now show Current net worth, Avg monthly growth, Stable X/N, and Reached X/N (was: Achieved X/N only).

### Added

- **`stableSince` field** on [`MilestoneRow`](frontend/src/pages/net-worth/netWorthProjection.ts). Computed by scanning backward for the last dip below target; returns the crossing date that stuck. `null` when the milestone is upcoming or when net worth is currently below threshold after a prior crossing. 5 new unit tests covering never-dipped, dipped-then-recovered, dipped-still-below, upcoming, and multiple-dips scenarios.

---

## 2.3.0 - 2026-04-25

Codebase-wide consolidation of hand-rolled UI primitives. A component-reuse audit found 35+ files re-implementing identical `<table>` + `<thead>` + `<tbody>` boilerplate and ~30 files repeating recharts config. This release ships a shared table primitive, a new radar chart wrapper, and migrates every file where the chart shape cleanly fits the existing wrappers.

### Added

- **`DataTable` primitive** ([frontend/src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx](frontend/src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx)) -- a generic, type-safe `<table>` with column-driven config, internal sort state (click or keyboard Enter/Space), optional row animation (auto-disabled above 200 rows), and per-row/per-cell className callbacks. 10 unit tests.
- **`StandardRadarChart`** ([frontend/src/components/analytics/StandardRadarChart.tsx](frontend/src/components/analytics/StandardRadarChart.tsx)) -- wraps the PolarGrid/PolarAngleAxis/PolarRadiusAxis/Radar boilerplate previously duplicated in `FinancialHealthScore` and `CFPScoreView`.

### Changed

- **Tables migrated to `DataTable`:** [MilestonesTable](frontend/src/pages/net-worth/components/MilestonesTable.tsx) (Net Worth), [MonthlyBreakdownTable](frontend/src/pages/trends-forecasts/components/MonthlyBreakdownTable.tsx) (Trends & Forecasts). Sort state moved off `useTrendsForecasts` into the table; hook now exposes `recentChartData` directly. `ariaSort` helper removed from `trendsUtils.tsx` (was only used by this table).
- **Charts migrated to `StandardBarChart`:** `YearOverYearComparison`, [DayOfWeekChart](frontend/src/pages/year-in-review/components/DayOfWeekChart.tsx), [CohortSpendingAnalysis](frontend/src/components/analytics/CohortSpendingAnalysis.tsx), `PeerComparisonBenchmarks`, `IncomeStabilityIndex` (horizontal), `LifestyleCreepDetection` (horizontal), `ExpenseElasticityChart` (horizontal).
- **Charts migrated to `StandardAreaChart`:** `SavingsMilestonesTimeline`, [InstrumentProjections](frontend/src/components/analytics/InstrumentProjections.tsx), [FIRECalculatorPage](frontend/src/pages/FIRECalculatorPage.tsx) projection chart.
- **Charts migrated to `StandardPieChart`:** [TopMerchants](frontend/src/components/analytics/TopMerchants.tsx), [DashboardPage](frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx) (income + expense donuts with center labels), [IncomeAnalysisPage](frontend/src/pages/income-analysis/IncomeAnalysisPage.tsx) income-by-category donut.
- **Charts migrated to `StandardRadarChart`:** [FinancialHealthScore](frontend/src/components/analytics/FinancialHealthScore.tsx), [CFPScoreView](frontend/src/components/analytics/health/CFPScoreView.tsx).

### Internal

- Wrapper extensions needed during migration: `StandardBarChart` gained `referenceLines`, `xDomain`/`xType`/`yType`, `yCategoryKey` for horizontal layout, `xTickFormatter`/`yTickFormatter`, `tooltipValueWithPayload` (advanced tooltip that sees the row), `barGap`, `hideVerticalGrid`/`hideHorizontalGrid`, per-bar `fillOpacity`/`getCellColor`. `StandardAreaChart` gained `strokeDasharray` on `AreaConfig`. `StandardPieChart` gained `onSliceClick` (with auto pointer cursor). All extensions are generic -- no file-specific escape hatches.
- Net ~160 LOC deleted across migrated files. Same visual output, one source of truth for chart styling.
- Deferred as intentionally custom (shape doesn't fit a generic wrapper): [CashFlowForecast](frontend/src/components/analytics/CashFlowForecast.tsx) (8 Areas with per-area strokeDasharray + confidence-cone trick), [EffectiveTaxRateChart](frontend/src/components/analytics/EffectiveTaxRateChart.tsx) (uses ReferenceDot), `SubcategoryAnalysis` (non-date x-axis with dots), [NetWorthPage](frontend/src/pages/net-worth/NetWorthPage.tsx) waterfall, [IncomeExpenseFlowPage](frontend/src/pages/income-expense-flow/IncomeExpenseFlowPage.tsx) Sankey, [SpendingAnalysisPage](frontend/src/pages/spending-analysis/SpendingAnalysisPage.tsx) nested pies, [TaxPlanningPage](frontend/src/pages/tax-planning/TaxPlanningPage.tsx) bar+line composed chart, [BudgetPage](frontend/src/pages/budget/BudgetPage.tsx) (mix of bar/area/radar in one page), plus IncomeAnalysisPage's area chart. Also deferred: the two non-flat tables ([TaxableIncomeTable](frontend/src/components/analytics/TaxableIncomeTable.tsx) expandable tree, [MultiYearProjectionTable](frontend/src/pages/tax-planning/components/MultiYearProjectionTable.tsx) pivot) -- these need dedicated primitives, not `DataTable` flags.

---

## 2.2.1 - 2026-04-25

Rework of the net-worth milestones feature from 2.2.0 after self-review found two visual issues.

### Changed

- **Unified Milestones table** -- the separate "Milestones Achieved" and "Next Targets" tables from 2.2.0 have been merged into a single "Net Worth Milestones" table. One row per threshold (₹1L through ₹10Cr), sorted low-to-high, with a Status column (✓ Achieved / ⏳ Upcoming), date, and notes. Removes visual redundancy and makes the "just crossed" → "next target" progression obvious at a glance.

### Fixed

- **Projection used a different "current" value than the chart ends at.** Old code passed the account-balance-derived `netWorth` (MetricCard value) into `projectNetWorth`, while the chart ended at the cumulative income-minus-expense series. On users where those two differ, the projection line had a vertical discontinuity at "today". Fixed: the projection anchor is now the last point of the filtered chart series, and milestones/ETAs use the same anchor value. No more jump.
- **Daily + monthly dates mixed on a categorical x-axis stretched the projection horizontally.** With 1,448 historical daily points + 60 monthly points on the same string-keyed axis, Recharts gave each unique date equal width, so the 60 projected months visually occupied ~4% of the axis while representing 5 years. When projection is ON, historical data is now downsampled to month-end points so the whole timeline renders at uniform monthly spacing.
- **"Today" reference line moved to the actual projection start** (the last historical point, labeled "Now") -- previously it used `new Date()` which could sit a few days past the last data point and create tiny visual artifacts.

### Internal

- `netWorthProjection.ts` API simplified: one `buildMilestoneRows(series, anchor, growth)` replaces the previous `detectMilestonesAchieved` + `computeMilestoneETAs` pair. Added `downsampleToMonthly` helper. `projectNetWorth` signature now takes an anchor point (date + value) instead of just a number.
- Removed `MilestonesAchieved.tsx` and `TargetProjectionsTable.tsx`. New `MilestonesTable.tsx` is the single consumer. 18 unit tests.

---

## 2.2.0 - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Net Worth milestones + projection** -- see 2.2.1 for the shipped design. This version had two separate tables and a projection anchor mismatch; fixed immediately in 2.2.1.

### Fixed (production data)

After the transfer-dedup fix in 2.1.6, production user 1's Cashback Shared account still showed a phantom -₹39 balance because the broken raw transactions never got re-ingested. Re-uploading through the UI (with force=true) recovers the 3 silently-dropped same-day duplicate transfer pairs and restores the 0.00 balance.

---

## 2.1.6 - 2026-04-25

Ingestion-pipeline fixes from a full xlsx vs DB audit.

### Fixed

- **Transfer reconciliation silently dropped duplicate same-day transfers** -- each real transfer appears in the source export as two rows (Transfer-In + Transfer-Out). The reconciler correctly collapsed paired legs via a set-based hash but couldn't distinguish "paired leg of same transfer" from "genuine second transfer of the same amount on the same day between the same accounts", so any user who recorded two identical transfers on one day lost one. Fix: normalizer emits `transfer_leg = "in" | "out"`; reconciler uses per-direction occurrence counters keyed on the canonical (date, amount, from, to, category, subcategory, note) tuple. 5 new regression tests in `test_transfer_reconciliation.py`.
- **`POST /api/analytics/v2/refresh` returned HTTP 500 on SQLite** -- the endpoint ran `SET statement_timeout = '120s'` (Postgres-only) unconditionally. Now guarded with `if session.bind.dialect.name == "postgresql"`.
- **`_calculate_category_trends` scrambled subcategory attribution** -- grouping key was `(period, category, type)` and stored subcategory was whichever sub appeared last in the loop. "Refund & Cashbacks" INCOME showed Credit Card Cashbacks ₹18,706 and Other Cashbacks ₹27,773 instead of the correct ₹43,774 / ₹4,086. Now groups by `(period, category, subcategory, type)`; 1,110 rows in `category_trends` instead of 594, matching raw totals exactly.
- **`AuditLog.user_id` was always NULL** -- `AnalyticsEngine._log_audit` never passed `user_id=self.user_id`. Now scoped per user so the audit trail can distinguish runs.
- **`/api/upload` now auto-triggers `run_full_analytics`** -- the defense-in-depth fix ensures pre-aggregated tables never drift from raw transactions when a client skips the explicit `/refresh` call.

---

## 2.1.5 - 2026-04-24

Second-pass audit: fixed calculation bugs, tightened user scoping, and hardened a few response/log paths. No UX changes.

### Fixed

- **FIRE monthly SIP compounding** -- `computeRetirementCorpus` used the naive `expectedReturn/12` as the monthly rate. At 12% effective annual that compounded to ~12.68% and understated the required SIP by ~12-13% for long horizons. Now uses `(1+r)^(1/12) - 1`. The year-by-year projection loop was rewritten to use the same monthly annuity-due so the final projected corpus converges on `requiredCorpus` within 1%
- **Tax surcharge order** -- surcharge is now computed on base tax (before Section 87A rebate), matching Indian tax code. Cess still applies on tax-after-rebate + surcharge. No practical impact today (87A ceiling sits well below any surcharge threshold) but the ordering is now correct for any future rule change
- **FY string year-2100 wraparound** -- `(year+1) % 100` formatted FY 2099-2100 as "2099-00"; now uses a helper that zero-pads the last two digits so 2100 renders as "00" correctly and collisions can't happen
- **Anomaly detection division-by-zero** -- `_detect_high_expense_months` raised `ZeroDivisionError` when all months had zero expenses. Guarded at the top: zero average short-circuits with no anomalies

### Security

- **Cross-user aggregation hardened** -- `AnalyticsEngine` now refuses per-user aggregations when `user_id` is `None` (previously those queries silently scanned every user's data). Three anomaly/budget queries (`_detect_high_expense_months`, `_detect_large_transactions`, `_update_budget_tracking`) rewired to use the explicit user filter
- **`/api/preferences/ai-config/key` response hardened** -- sets `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, private, max-age=0` and `Pragma: no-cache` so the decrypted API key can't land in intermediary proxy caches, disk cache, or service workers
- **OAuth error logs redacted** -- Google and GitHub token-exchange failures now log only `status` and the provider's `error` field instead of the full response body. Prevents leaking short-lived codes or internal provider URLs into log aggregators
- **Upload row cap** -- `TransactionUploadRequest.rows` bounded at 100_000 (well above a busy user's annual volume). Prevents an authenticated client from DoS-ing via arbitrarily large request bodies

### Tests

- Added `taxCalculator.test.ts` (12 tests: slab math, 87A rebate, surcharge-on-base-tax, cess, FY helpers)
- Extended `fireCalculator.test.ts` (+3 tests: effective-monthly-rate regression, projection convergence, zero-return handling)
- Extended `projectionCalculator.test.ts` (+1 test: FY 2099/2100 wrap)
- Added `test_analytics_user_scoping.py` (5 integration tests: zero-guard, user-id-required, cross-user isolation for two anomaly paths)
- Added `test_upload_schema.py` (3 unit tests: row cap enforcement)
- Totals: backend 70 tests (up from 62), frontend 65 tests (up from 49)

---

## 2.1.4 - 2026-04-24

### Security

- **python-dotenv CVE-2026-28684** -- constrained to `>=1.2.2` via `pyproject.toml`'s `constraint-dependencies`. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary file overwrite via cross-device rename fallback when `.env` was a symlink
- **PBKDF2 salt hardened** -- initial encryption implementation used a hardcoded salt; now uses a random 128-bit salt per ciphertext (salt + nonce + ciphertext base64-encoded into a single field). Flagged by SonarCloud

---

## 2.1.3 - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Pages folder structure standardized** -- every multi-file page now has the same layout: `<page>/PageName.tsx + use<Page>.ts + types.ts + *utils.ts + components/`. Kebab-case for directories, PascalCase for single-file pages
- **`pages/IncomeExpenseFlowPage/`** renamed to `pages/income-expense-flow/` for kebab-case consistency
- **`pages/SettingsPage.tsx`** moved into `pages/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`; sub-sections moved into `pages/settings/sections/`; `settings/components.tsx` renamed to `settings/sectionPrimitives.tsx`
- **Frontend page-level `index.ts` barrel files** removed per CLAUDE.md policy ("no barrel files")
- **Thin re-export stubs deleted** -- `ComparisonPage.tsx`, `GoalsPage.tsx`, `SubscriptionTrackerPage.tsx` were one-line re-exports and have been removed; routes now import directly from the page folders
- Every multi-file page folder now has a `components/` subfolder (settings uses `sections/` instead because "section" is the domain term)

### Removed

- **Issue backlog cleanup** -- closed #70 (Recharts -> Nivo migration, no user benefit for massive work), #13 (Finance Levels gamification page, out of scope), #84 (Lighthouse CI, maintenance burden > value for solo-dev project), #89 (already fixed by enum migration)

---

## 2.1.2 - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **`pages/BillCalendarPage.tsx`** (799 lines) split into `pages/bill-calendar/` module: `BillCalendarPage.tsx`, `useBillCalendar.ts`, `billUtils.ts`, `types.ts`, plus 4 sub-components in `components/`
- **`pages/YearInReviewPage.tsx`** (757 lines) split into `pages/year-in-review/` module: orchestrator + `useYearInReview.ts` + `heatmapUtils.ts` + `types.ts` + 4 new sub-components; existing StatCard/InsightRow/DayOfWeekChart moved into `components/`
- **`pages/TrendsForecastsPage.tsx`** (775 lines) split into `pages/trends-forecasts/` module with same structure
- **`pages/TaxPlanningPage.tsx`** (1,090 lines) split into `pages/tax-planning/` module with `useTaxPlanning.ts` + `taxPlanningUtils.ts` + `types.ts` + 6 sub-components (TaxPageActions, TaxTip, RegimeVerdictDetail, RegimeComparison, DeductionInput, MultiYearProjectionTable)
- **`core/analytics_engine.py`** -- extracted module-level helpers (`_group_txns_by_pattern`, `_resolve_pattern_display`, `_aggregate_holdings_data`) and constants (`DEFAULT_ESSENTIAL_CATEGORIES`, `DEFAULT_INVESTMENT_ACCOUNT_PATTERNS`) into new `core/_analytics_helpers.py` (full class-level mixin split deferred to a future PR)

---

## 2.1.1 - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **`db/models.py`** split into `db/_models/` package (7 domain files: `enums.py`, `user.py`, `transactions.py`, `investments.py`, `analytics.py`, `planning.py` + `__init__.py` facade). `db/models.py` is now a 21-line re-export facade; consumer imports unchanged

---

## 2.1.0 - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **AI Finance Chatbot** (closes #90) -- floating chat widget (bottom-right) with glass-morphism UI, streaming token-by-token responses, and conversation history per session
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** -- configure OpenAI, Anthropic, or AWS Bedrock in Settings > AI Assistant; provider list updated to current models (O3, O4 Mini, GPT-4.1 family, GPT-4o family, Claude Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5, Bedrock `us.anthropic.claude-*-v1` variants)
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** (`core/encryption.py`) -- API keys encrypted at rest with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation
- **Bedrock streaming proxy** (`api/ai_chat.py`) -- browser cannot call Bedrock directly (requires SigV4 + binary EventStream parsing), so `POST /api/ai/bedrock/chat` proxies via `boto3.client('bedrock-runtime').converse_stream()`
- **Financial context builder** (`lib/chatContext.ts`) -- fetches monthly summaries, category breakdowns, recurring bills, net worth, and goals from existing V2 endpoints; compresses into a ~2-4K token system prompt so the AI has full financial context
- **Chat adapters** (`lib/chatAdapters.ts`) -- provider-specific streaming request builders and SSE stream parsers (OpenAI/Anthropic go browser-direct, Bedrock goes through backend proxy)
- **AI config endpoints** -- `PUT/GET/DELETE /api/preferences/ai-config` for configuring provider/model/api_key; `GET /api/preferences/ai-config/key` returns decrypted key for frontend streaming calls
- **`DecryptionError` class** -- raised when the JWT secret rotates between saving and using a key; frontend shows "re-enter your API key" prompt
- **Alembic migration** -- adds `ai_provider`, `ai_model`, `ai_api_key_encrypted` columns to `user_preferences`

### Fixed

- **Bedrock 400 errors from browser** -- bearer tokens don't work for Bedrock inference (SigV4 required), CORS is not supported. Proxy through backend fixed both issues
- **Chat widget double-rendering** -- `doStream()` was being called inside a `setMessages` updater, causing React StrictMode to spawn two parallel streams in dev; rewritten to call streaming outside the state updater
- **Recurring frequency enum bug** (closes #89) -- semi-annual, weekly, biweekly, quarterly recurring transactions were returning 500 errors due to missing enum values in PostgreSQL; fixed by migration `20260412_1200_add_missing_recurrence_enum_values.py`

---

## 2.0.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Client-side file parsing** -- Excel/CSV files are now parsed in the browser using SheetJS; only structured JSON rows are sent to the backend (breaking API change: `POST /api/upload` now accepts JSON body instead of multipart file)
- **Frontend file parser** (`lib/fileParser.ts`) -- lazy-loads SheetJS, computes SHA-256 hash via `crypto.subtle`, maps flexible column names, validates dates/amounts/types
- **Column mapping constants** (`constants/columns.ts`) -- shared column name mappings and valid transaction types
- **CSV upload support** -- dropzone now accepts `.csv` files in addition to `.xlsx` and `.xls`
- **Backend JSON upload schema** (`schemas/upload.py`) -- `TransactionRow` and `TransactionUploadRequest` Pydantic models for structured upload validation
- **`SyncEngine.import_rows()`** -- new method accepting pre-parsed JSON rows from the frontend
- **`DataNormalizer.normalize_from_dict()`** -- normalizes plain dicts (category corrections, account standardization, transfer resolution) for the JSON upload path
- **Income & tax projections** -- input your salary CTC structure (basic, HRA, special allowance, EPF, NPS, professional tax, variable pay) per fiscal year, with FY-to-FY navigation and editing
- **RSU grant management** -- add stock grants with vesting schedules; vesting amounts auto-projected with stock appreciation
- **Growth assumptions** -- configure annual salary hike, variable pay growth, stock appreciation, and projection horizon; projections compound from the latest salary FY
- **Multi-year tax comparison table** -- side-by-side projected gross, tax, and net across future fiscal years
- **Projection calculator** (`lib/projectionCalculator.ts`) -- pure functions for multi-year salary/RSU/tax projection with full TDD test coverage
- **Salary Pydantic schemas** -- `SalaryComponents`, `RsuGrant`, `GrowthAssumptions` with backend validation
- **Three new preference endpoints** -- `PUT /api/preferences/salary-structure`, `PUT /api/preferences/rsu-grants`, `PUT /api/preferences/growth-assumptions`
- **Alembic migration** -- adds `salary_structure`, `rsu_grants`, `growth_assumptions` JSON columns to `user_preferences`
- **Indirect Tax (GST) analysis page** -- estimates GST paid on expenses using official slab rates (0/3/5/18/28%) with subcategory-first lookup; includes summary cards, GST-by-slab donut chart, monthly trend bar chart, and category breakdown table
- **YoY % change badges** -- Tax Planning summary cards show year-over-year percentage changes comparing actual data for past FYs and salary projections for current/future FYs
- **Stock price auto-fetch** -- RSU grant editor fetches live stock prices via Yahoo Finance backend proxy (`GET /api/stock-price/{symbol}`), auto-converts from stock currency to display currency
- **Account reset modes** -- Profile modal offers two reset options: "Reset Transactions" (preserves preferences, budgets, goals) and "Complete Reset" (wipes everything); backend `POST /api/auth/account/reset` accepts `mode` query parameter (`full` | `transactions`)
- **Analytics refresh endpoint** -- `POST /api/analytics/v2/refresh` recomputes all pre-aggregated analytics tables synchronously; called by the frontend after upload instead of relying on `BackgroundTasks` (which can be killed on Vercel serverless before completion)

### Changed

- **Upload pipeline** -- four-phase UX (Parsing -> Processing -> Uploading -> Computing Analytics) with clear progress indication; analytics refresh is a separate synchronous request for serverless reliability; force-reupload reuses already-parsed data without re-parsing the file
- **Upload API** -- `POST /api/upload` now accepts `{ file_name, file_hash, rows, force }` JSON body instead of multipart file upload (breaking change)
- **SheetJS upgraded** -- migrated from vulnerable npm `xlsx@0.18.5` to CDN-distributed `xlsx@0.20.3` (fixes GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6 Prototype Pollution and GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9 ReDoS)
- **Upload error handling** -- Axios error codes mapped to user-friendly toast messages; conflict state (duplicate file) now offers force-reupload inline
- **Tax Planning page** -- extended with salary-based projection toggle, stacked paid-vs-projected tax bars in yearly chart, projection-aware labels throughout
- **Settings page** -- new "Income & Salary Structure" section with salary grid, RSU grant editor, and growth assumption sliders
- **preferencesStore** -- hydration logic extracted into standalone pure helpers to reduce cognitive complexity (SonarCloud finding)
- **tsconfig** -- bumped `lib` from ES2022 to ES2023 for `Array.findLast()` support

### Removed

- **Server-side file parsing for uploads** -- backend no longer receives raw Excel/CSV files via the upload endpoint (CLI still uses the old file-based `import_file()` path)
- **Temporary file handling** -- removed temp file creation, magic byte validation, and chunked file reading from upload endpoint

### Fixed

- **Upload stuck with no feedback in production** (issue #72) -- root cause was Vercel 60s serverless timeout combined with large file uploads; solved by moving parsing to the client
- **Zero-amount transactions rejected** -- `TransactionRow.amount` validation changed from `gt=0` to `ge=0` to accept valid zero-amount rows
- **Sticky PageHeader consistency** -- moved PageHeader outside Framer Motion containers on InsightsPage, FIRECalculatorPage, and TaxPlanningPage so `position: sticky` works correctly (CSS `transform` from animations was breaking it)
- **Scroll-to-top on navigation** -- reset `#main-content` scroll position on route change so every page starts from the top
- **Returns Analysis FY switching** (issue #88) -- CAGR and Monthly ROI now update when changing fiscal year
- **TaxPlanningPage cognitive complexity** -- extracted helper functions to bring SonarCloud score under threshold
- **Chart hover/tooltip standardization** -- consistent hover states and tooltip styling across all chart pages
- **SonarCloud findings** -- `localeCompare` for string sorts, `Number.parseInt` over global `parseInt`, `findLast` over `filter().at(-1)`, extracted nested ternaries, composite keys for RSU vesting rows
- **SonarCloud cognitive complexity** -- extracted helper functions in QuickInsights, InvestmentAnalyticsPage, generateDerivedData, and generateTransactions to bring S3776 scores under threshold
- **Projected tax bar color** -- uses orange instead of green to distinguish from paid tax
- **Sidebar double-highlight** -- NavLink `end` prop prevents parent route from highlighting alongside child

---

## 1.9.0 - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Multi-currency display conversion** -- view all financial data in 15 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, SGD, AED, CNY, KRW, SEK, NZD, HKD) with live ECB exchange rates via frankfurter.dev
- **Currency quick-switcher** -- sidebar currency selector for instant switching with rate indicator pill showing live conversion (e.g., "1 USD = INR 92.68")
- **Exchange rate proxy** -- backend endpoint (`GET /api/exchange-rates`) with 24h in-memory cache and three-tier fallback (fresh cache, stale cache, hardcoded rates)
- **Currency metadata constants** -- `currencies.ts` with locale, symbol, number format, and short unit configuration per currency
- **`display_currency` preference** -- persisted per-user with Alembic migration, auto-derives number format, symbol, and symbol position
- **Google Analytics tracking** -- site-wide analytics via G-PFFMG7D8DP

### Changed

- **Settings: Display Preferences** -- replaced manual number format, currency symbol, and symbol position fields with a single "Display Currency" dropdown that auto-derives all three
- **Formatters** -- `formatCurrency`, `formatCurrencyCompact`, and `formatCurrencyShort` now apply exchange rate conversion automatically via `convertAmount()` helper
- **Formatter short units** -- `formatCurrencyShort` switches between Cr/L/K (INR) and B/M/K (international) based on display currency metadata
- **Documentation rebrand** -- updated README, CLAUDE.md, package.json, pyproject.toml, and all docs with "Personal Finance Dashboard" tagline and compelling descriptions

---

## 1.8.1 - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Pre-computed daily summaries** -- `daily_summaries` table for instant heatmap rendering (income, expenses, net, transaction counts, top category per day)
- **Daily summaries API** -- `GET /api/analytics/v2/daily-summaries` with date range and limit filters
- **Investment holdings API** -- `GET /api/analytics/v2/investment-holdings` with active_only filter and portfolio summary
- **Auto-populate investment holdings** -- analytics engine dynamically detects investment accounts from preferences and computes net invested amounts from transfer flows

### Changed

- **Calculations fast path** -- `get_totals`, `get_monthly_aggregation`, and `get_category_breakdown` read from pre-computed tables when no date filter is active
- **YearInReview heatmap** -- uses daily summaries instead of scanning all transactions

### Fixed

- User scoping, cascades, indexes, and constraints added to database schema
- Regex backtracking risk eliminated in note normalization
- SonarCloud findings resolved, mobile responsiveness improved

---

## 1.8.0 - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Demo mode** -- "Try Demo" on landing page lets visitors explore the full dashboard with ~500 realistic sample transactions, zero signup
- **Smart account classification** -- keyword matching for EPF, PPF, Mutual Funds, Groww, Zerodha, FD, Stocks, Gold, Crypto as Investments; Indian banks as Bank Accounts; EMI/mortgage as Loans
- **Auto income classification** -- Salary/Freelance to Taxable, Dividends/Interest to Investment Returns, Cashbacks to Non-taxable
- **Auto investment account mapping** -- MF/Groww to mutual_funds, Stocks/Zerodha to stocks, FD to fixed_deposits, PPF/EPF/NPS to ppf_epf
- **Backend migrated to Vercel** -- replaced Render (30-50s cold starts) with Vercel serverless via Mangum for zero cold start latency
- **Neon database via Vercel integration** -- unified dashboard management
- **Alembic migration workflow** -- GitHub Actions runs migrations on push to main when schema files change

### Changed

- Demo banner uses floating pill overlay instead of sticky bar
