/**
 * Forward TDS schedule -- models how an employer deducts tax month by month.
 *
 * Unlike a reactive "tax on income received to date" view, payroll projects
 * your full-year income from April and deducts tax proportionally, truing-up
 * whenever income changes. The current Tax Planning caller uses:
 *
 *   - Recurring taxable compensation excluding bonus and RSU as the flat base.
 *   - Annual bonus split into 12 equal monthly extras.
 *   - RSU vestings as dated extras in their vesting month.
 *
 * Per month the algorithm is:
 *   baselineMonthly = calculateTax(regular*12) / 12          (flat all year)
 *   on an extra's month, add the MARGINAL tax on that extra:
 *     calculateTax(regular*12 + extrasIncludingThis)
 *       - calculateTax(regular*12 + extrasBeforeThis)
 *
 * So regular salary TDS is a flat baseline. Bonus adds a monthly marginal
 * increment, while an RSU's tax appears as a one-month spike. The marginal tax
 * is computed progressively (including prior extras) so slab stacking stays
 * correct, and the monthly amounts telescope to exactly the full-year tax on
 * total income.
