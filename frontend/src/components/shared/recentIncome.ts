 * An all-time mean (`totalIncome / monthsInRange`) is the wrong denominator for
 * those: measured on the real ledger it is 68,130.93/month across the 2,769-day
 * span, while the median of the last 12 complete months is 216,756.94 -- a 3.2x
 * gap, because income grew from ~17k/month in 2019 to ~220k now. The 115,027.89
 * of active fixed commitments therefore published as 168.8% coverage, labelled
 * "High fixed cost load", when the honest figure is 53.1%.
 *
 * The month in progress is excluded for the same reason `medianSpendingMonth`
 * excludes it -- a partial month reads low and would inflate the ratio. Months
 * with zero income are dropped because they cannot serve as a divisor (the real
 * ledger has one: 2019-02). Returns `null` when no complete month with income
 * exists, so the caller decides rather than dividing by nothing.
