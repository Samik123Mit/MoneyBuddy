 * row is four days out; a user with a year of forward-booked SIPs inflates the
 * divisor by the whole horizon while the numerator cannot follow.

 *
 * 1. `Math.max(days / 30.44, 1)` floored a partial month at a whole one. The
 *    monthly view (July capped at today, 27 of 31 days) billed 27 days as 1.0000
 *    months and published a burn rate of 107,651.65 where the pace those 27 days
 *    set is 123,600.04 -- a 12.9% understatement, worst on the 1st of the month
 *    and self-correcting only on the 31st. The same floor divided the
 *    recurring-coverage income denominator by 1.0 instead of 0.871, making fixed
 *    commitments look like a larger share of income than they are.
 *
 * 2. The 30.44-day average month was wrong in the other direction for COMPLETE
 *    months of any length but 30.44. A finished 30-day June came out 0.9855
 *    months and reported 110,099.46 against a real June spend of 108,508.01;
 *    a 28-day February reported 106,483.19 against 97,947.74 (+8.7%). A month is
 *    one month regardless of how many days it holds, so the fraction is taken per
 *    month against that month's own length.
 *
 * Guarded at a small positive floor so a same-day window cannot divide by zero.
