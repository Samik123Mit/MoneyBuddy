/**
 * The CALENDAR months a window covers, given the months that carry rows.
 *
 * One source of truth for "which months is this page talking about", because two
 * consumers have to agree exactly: the "Monthly Avg" KPI (and the Avg reference
 * line drawn from it) and the Expense Trend bars. When the KPI divided by the
 * selected window while the chart plotted only row-bearing months, the reference
 * line could sit below EVERY bar while labelled as their average -- reproduced
 * this session on a yearly-2025 window whose rows start in June: 7 bars of
 * 70,000.00 with an Avg line at 40,833.33 and `everyBarAboveAvgLine: true`.
 * Sharing the spine makes the line the mean of the bars by construction.
 *
 * The window comes from the range when it is bounded (a chosen FY is 12 months
 * whether or not you spent in all of them) and from the rows themselves when it
 * is not (all-time has no start date, so its end is whatever the last row says).
 * On that open-ended path the end is capped at the CURRENT month via
 * `currentMonthKey`, because a future-dated row would otherwise append empty
 * months -- this ledger holds a 2026-07-31 row and one dated a year out would add
 * twelve zero months. The cap stops at the current month rather than the last
 * complete one: excluding the in-progress month is the caller's job (it passes a
 * complete-months range), and this is also reached on that range's documented
 * empty fallback, where the month in progress is the only data there is.
 *
 * Returns the row months unchanged when the window spans none of them (an
 * all-future or inverted range), so the page shows their real total rather than a
 * zero.

/**
 * Mean and median spend per CALENDAR month over a window.
 *
 * The divisor is every month in the window, not just the months that happen to
 * carry a row. "Monthly Avg" claims a per-month figure, and a month you spent
 * nothing in is still a month; dividing by months-with-activity silently answers
 * a different question ("average per month in which I spent"). Measured on the
 * real ledger on 2026-07-27 over its complete months: 3,887,099.76 across 89
 * months-with-expense = 43,675.28, against 90 calendar months (2019-03 has no
 * expense row) = 43,190.00. Small at whole-ledger scale, but this page is
 * category deep-linkable and the gap scales with sparsity -- `?category=Family`
 * spans 87 months and carries rows in 48, so the same KPI read 27,002.56 instead
 * of 14,897.96, an 81.3% overstatement of that category's monthly cost.
 *
 * The window itself comes from {@link spanMonthKeys}, which the Expense Trend
 * series shares, so the "Avg" reference line drawn from this mean is the mean of
 * the bars actually plotted.
 *
 * The MEAN stays the headline. Budget and runway math needs the total spread
 * over the period -- you spend the total, not the median -- so the median is
 * returned alongside for disclosure rather than as a replacement.
 *
 * The median keeps ZERO months in, matching the mean's divisor: both answer "what
 * does a month cost", and dropping the empty months from one but not the other
 * ships two different definitions of month under one subtitle. See
 * `medianSpendingMonth` in `components/shared/quickInsightsData.ts`, which had
 * drifted the other way.
