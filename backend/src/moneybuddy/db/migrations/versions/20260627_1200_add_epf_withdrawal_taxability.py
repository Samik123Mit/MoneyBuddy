"""add epf withdrawal taxability preference

Revision ID: epf_taxability_2026
Revises: f7a8b9c0d1e2
Create Date: 2026-06-27 12:00:00.000000

Adds two columns to user_preferences so EPF inflow taxability is a user-owned
choice instead of the old hardcoded 50% heuristic:
  - epf_withdrawal_taxable (bool, default False): treat EPF inflows as exempt
    (the common post-5-year-service case) unless the user opts in.
  - epf_taxable_percent (int 0-100, default 100): fraction counted as taxable
    when the toggle is on.
