"""fold case-variant account names onto one canonical spelling

Revision ID: account_case_fold_2026
Revises: partial_tx_indexes_2026
Create Date: 2026-07-15 10:00:00.000000

"CC: Axis Google Flex" and "CC: AXIS Google Flex" are the same real
account, but the app treated them as two: two rows in Settings ->
Account Classifications, two balances on the net-worth page, split
analytics. The transaction hash lowercases account names, so re-uploads
never duplicated rows -- but the stored ``account`` field is not
updateable, so rows imported before a casing fix kept the old spelling
forever alongside newer rows with the new spelling.

This migration folds every case-variant group (per user) onto one
canonical spelling -- the spelling used by the most transaction rows --
across:

- ``transactions`` (account, from_account, to_account) and the
  "Transfer: A → B" category label that embeds the account names
- ``account_classifications`` (duplicate rows merged, most recently
  updated row wins the classification value)
- ``scheduled_transactions`` / ``recurring_transactions``
- ``user_preferences.excluded_accounts`` (JSON array of exact names)

Rollup tables (transfer_flows, investment_holdings, summaries) are
rebuilt from transactions on the next analytics refresh, so they are
left untouched. Import-time canonicalization in
``SyncEngine._canonicalize_account_casing`` keeps future uploads from
reintroducing variants.

Follows the repo convention of an empty ``downgrade()`` (restore from a
database backup to roll back).
