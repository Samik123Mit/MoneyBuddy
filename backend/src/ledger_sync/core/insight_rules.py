"""Tunable thresholds and calendar rules for the written-insight engine.

Split out of ``insights.py`` so the engine file stays inside the 200-line
budget, and so the two things a future tweak touches -- the numeric thresholds
and the definition of a "complete" month -- live in one place instead of being
inlined at each decision site.

The calendar helpers here encode the repo-wide partial-month split:

* **Totals may include the month in progress.** Money already spent is real.
* **Averages, trends, volatility, peaks and growth rates may not.** A month
  three days old is not a comparable observation. Measured against the real
  workbook, letting one in-progress month into a rate produced a -696.8%
  figure, and on the Income Analysis page it turned a true +18.1% growth rate
  into -95.6%.

``is_partial_month`` deliberately matches the frontend's ``getMonthProgress``
(``frontend/src/lib/dateUtils.ts``) so the same month is judged the same way on
both sides of the API: only the CURRENT month can be partial, and not on its
final calendar day, where every day of the month already exists.
