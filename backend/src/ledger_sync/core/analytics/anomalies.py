"""Anomaly detection + budget tracking mixin.

## Detection algorithms

Uses robust statistics (median + MAD, with IQR fence fallback) instead of
mean + stdev, so a single outlier month doesn't self-mask by inflating both
the mean and the standard deviation. The historical mean+stdev approach
missed genuine anomalies exactly when they mattered most: one 3x-of-normal
month raised the sample mean by ~25% and stdev by ~50%, silently pushing
its own modified-Z score below the flagging cutoff.

- **High-expense-month detection**: Iglewicz-Hoaglin modified Z-score
  ``|0.6745 * (x - median) / MAD|`` with configurable cutoff (default 3.5,
  the NIST-recommended outlier boundary), computed against a ROLLING
  trailing-12-month baseline (excluding the month under test). An all-time
  baseline on a non-stationary spend series (income growth, lifestyle
  drift) made every recent month look anomalous versus years-old medians.
  When the window's MAD collapses to zero (identical months), fall back to
  Tukey's upper IQR fence (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR) over the same window.

- **Large-transaction detection**: 12-month rolling per-category median,
  gated by (a) a per-user materiality floor (fraction of median monthly
  expense) and (b) a log-space modified-Z outlier test against the
  category's own amount distribution. The bare ratio>=3 rule flagged
  14.4% of all expenses on real data because right-skewed spend
  categories make "3x the median" trivially reachable; the gates cut
  that to ~2% while keeping genuine outliers.

## Threshold preservation across the algorithm swap

The existing user preference ``anomaly_expense_threshold`` stored a stdev
multiplier (default 2.0). To avoid a semantic-drift incident on deploy
(where every user's stored threshold would suddenly mean something
completely different), the new code maps the stdev-multiplier space onto
the modified-Z cutoff space:

    effective_z_cutoff = 3.5 * (stored_threshold / 2.0)

So the default 2.0 gives the recommended 3.5 modified-Z cutoff; a user
who tuned to 2.5 (stricter) gets 4.375; a user who tuned to 1.5 (looser)
gets 2.625. Same knob, better math underneath, no migration required.
