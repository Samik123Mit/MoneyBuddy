    # ``is_user_confirmed`` is a single boolean that records a USER decision,
    # and rows carrying it are preserved across refreshes while every other row
    # is deleted and re-derived. A detector that writes it therefore breaks four
    # ways at once: the promoted row outlives the transactions it was built from
    # (a cancelled subscription bills forever), a renamed note spawns a second
    # row while the stale one keeps being summed, ``expected_day`` / frequency /
    # account freeze at their first-seen values, and a user who un-confirms the
    # row has that decision silently reverted on the next refresh -- the model
    # has no "rejected" marker to hold it.
    #
    # ``recurring_auto_confirm_occurrences`` stays a preference with no reader
    # here on purpose: promoting a guess to a user decision needs a separate
    # column (detector-owned vs user-owned) plus a rejection state, which is a
    # schema change, not a detection tweak. Unconfirmed rows are not invisible --
    # the dashboard, subscription tracker and bill calendar all render detected
    # commitments and label them "Detected".

        while ``pattern_name`` stores the raw most-recent note (e.g. "Rent Mar
        2026"). Keying each confirmed record by BOTH the normalized name and the
        plain lowercase name lets the refresh find the confirmed row under the
        stable group label ("rent") instead of creating an unconfirmed duplicate
        while the confirmed row's stats freeze.

        The type is part of the key because the groups are: an Income "Fee" and
        an Expense "Fee" are two different patterns, and keying on the label
        alone collapsed them into one dict entry -- so one row absorbed the
