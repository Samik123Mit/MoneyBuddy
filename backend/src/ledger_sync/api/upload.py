"""Upload API endpoint for pre-parsed transaction data.

The frontend parses Excel/CSV files client-side and sends structured JSON
rows. This endpoint validates, normalizes, hashes, and reconciles
transactions, then triggers analytics recomputation so pre-aggregated
tables (monthly_summaries, daily_summaries, investment_holdings, etc.)
stay in sync with the raw transactions. The explicit POST
/api/analytics/v2/refresh endpoint remains available for manual re-syncs.
