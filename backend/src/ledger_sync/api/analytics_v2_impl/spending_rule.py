"""50/30/20 budget-rule aggregation endpoint.

Returns per-category monthly averages classified into Needs / Wants / Savings
buckets for a user-selected date range, plus header totals and delta-vs-target
scoring.

THE INVARIANT: the buckets are shares of one income denominator and they
reconcile to it exactly --

    needs + wants + savings + unallocated == income_total

No expense rupee may land in two expense buckets: Needs and Wants partition
``expense_total`` exactly. ``unallocated`` is the explicit residual (income that
was neither spent nor allocated into an investment), not a fudge factor: the
other three are measured independently and it absorbs the rest.

Only the four-way SUM is bounded by income. Any individual bucket may exceed it
-- a lump sum invested out of savings accumulated earlier pushes ``savings``
past 100% and drives ``unallocated`` negative, exactly as a year of overspending
does. Both are real outcomes and must not be clamped away.

Bucket rules:

- **Needs**: expense categories that are either in the user's
  ``essential_categories`` preference OR in the built-in Indian defaults
  (Rent, Housing, EMI, Utilities, Groceries, Fuel, Transport, Insurance,
  Healthcare, Education, Family Support, Internet, Phone).
- **Wants**: any expense that is not Needs (Dining, Entertainment, Shopping,
  Travel, Subscriptions, etc.). The residual expense bucket.
- **Savings**: the NET CHANGE in the investment-account perimeter (SIP, MF,
  PPF, EPF, NPS, Stocks, RD, FD). Every row that moves the perimeter balance
  moves this bucket by the same signed amount, so the figure is checkable
  against a per-account balance delta.
- **Unallocated**: ``income - needs - wants - savings``.

Transfers are why this needs stating so precisely. A self-transfer writes the
same rupee twice -- once leaving the source account, once arriving at the
destination -- so on the owner's ledger transfers carry 60% of total rupee
volume while representing no income and no expense at all. Four row shapes
move the perimeter balance and therefore the Savings bucket:

- TRANSFER bank -> investment: ``savings += amount`` (a real allocation)
- TRANSFER investment -> bank: ``savings -= amount`` (a redemption, the
  reverse: money coming back out)
- INCOME credited on an investment account: ``savings += amount``. An EPF
  contribution, an RSU vest or a reinvested dividend never crosses the
  perimeter as a TRANSFER -- it lands already allocated. Without this it would
  only inflate the income denominator (239,536 all-time on the owner's ledger)
  and a user whose EPF is their main vehicle would read as saving nothing.
- EXPENSE booked ON an investment account: ``savings -= amount``. A brokerage
  fee or a realised loss is spending (so it also lands in Needs/Wants and in
  ``expense_total``, once each) AND it shrinks the holding. The two entries
  carry opposite signs, which is the flow-of-funds identity, not a
  double-count: the rupee was already deducted from ``unallocated`` when it
  first crossed into the perimeter.

Everything else is skipped: bank -> bank shuffles, card repayments, wallet
top-ups, ledger settlements and investment -> investment reallocations all
keep the same rupee on both legs.

One EXPENSE shape is exempt from the Needs/Wants split entirely: a row whose
taxonomy the user classified as a realised capital loss (``core.expense_class``).
It consumed nothing, so it stays out of ``expense_total`` and out of both expense
buckets and only shrinks the perimeter. The preference ships EMPTY, so this path
is inert until a user classifies something and no historical figure moves on its
own.

This means a contribution only registers as Savings if it is logged as a
TRANSFER into the holding. An EXPENSE row booked on a broker account reads as
money LEAVING that holding, because ``account`` is the account the money left
-- so a SIP logged as an expense lands in Wants and reduces Savings. Log
contributions as TRANSFER rows.

Reads live transactions rather than pre-aggregated rollups because the bucket
classification depends on the current preferences (essential_categories,
investment_account_mappings) and a rollup would drift if a user tunes those.

    The three ``buckets`` percentages plus ``unallocated_pct_of_income`` sum to
    100. ``unallocated_*`` are new keys; every pre-existing key keeps its name
    and type. ``savings_amount`` keeps its name but changes MEANING: it used to
    be (income - expense) and is now the net perimeter change, so any UI label
    reading "income minus expenses" over this number is stale.

    Each individual bucket is bounded only by the four-way sum, NOT by income:
    a period funded from savings accumulated earlier can push ``savings`` past
    100% of that period's income and drive ``unallocated`` negative. That is a
    real outcome, not an error, and it must not be clamped.

    target, signed so positive is "on the right side" for the bucket (under
