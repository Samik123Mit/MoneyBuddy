## Why

Ledger Sync is built for people who want useful personal finance analysis without handing over direct bank access or paying a recurring subscription. It supports Indian fiscal years and tax planning, multi-currency display, transaction organization, investments, goals, recurring commitments, and FIRE planning.

- [Open the hosted app](https://sagargupta.online/ledger-sync/)
- [Explore demo data](https://sagargupta.online/ledger-sync/demo)
- [Read the deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Highlights

### Import and reconciliation

- Accepts `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and `.csv` statements.
- Parses files in the browser with SheetJS.
- Sends validated JSON rows to the API instead of uploading the source file.
- Uses deterministic SHA-256 transaction IDs plus occurrence counters so repeated imports remain idempotent without collapsing legitimate duplicate rows.
- Soft-deletes rows no longer present in the latest import and refreshes analytics after reconciliation.

### Financial workspace

- Dashboard and fixed Overview for quick financial status.
- Server-paginated transaction ledger with search, filters, tags, saved views, sorting, and CSV export.
- Expense, income, cash flow, period comparison, year review, forecasting, and net worth analysis.
- Investment analytics, SIP projections, XIRR/CAGR returns, and instrument projections.
- 50/30/20 budget analysis, goals, recurring commitments, bill calendar, and anomaly review.
- Merchant intelligence derived from transaction notes, with spend concentration and recurring detection.
- Data health reporting: ledger coverage, last-import row counts, and whether analytics rollups are current.
- Indian income tax, RSU vesting, projected TDS, GST estimation, and FIRE planning.

### AI assistant

- Fifteen read-only, user-scoped financial tools.
- App-provided Bedrock mode with a daily message limit.
- BYOK configuration for supported providers with configurable token limits.
- AES-256-GCM encrypted key storage. Current ciphertexts use HKDF-SHA256 with `LEDGER_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; legacy PBKDF2 ciphertexts remain readable during migration.
- Financial data is fetched through tools when needed instead of being copied into a large prompt.

### Responsive UI

- Compact desktop workspace with grouped navigation, search, notifications, theme control, and AI access.
- Phone bottom navigation plus a complete More page.
- Light and dark themes. New users start on the operating system preference.
- Mobile card layouts for wide data tables and 44px touch targets for primary controls.
- Distinct loading, empty, and retryable error states across protected financial pages.
- Installable PWA that never caches API responses.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 11
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sagargupta16/ledger-sync.git
cd ledger-sync
pnpm install
pnpm run setup
pnpm run dev
```

Local services:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8000`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Configuration

Copy the required `LEDGER_SYNC_*` entries from [.env.example](.env.example) into `backend/.env`.

```env
LEDGER_SYNC_ENVIRONMENT=development
LEDGER_SYNC_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./ledger_sync.db
LEDGER_SYNC_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
LEDGER_SYNC_JWT_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters
LEDGER_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=replace-with-a-separate-random-key

# Configure at least one provider for real sign-in.
LEDGER_SYNC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
LEDGER_SYNC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
LEDGER_SYNC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
LEDGER_SYNC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Local frontend development uses Vite's same-origin `/api` proxy. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` only when the built frontend and API are hosted on different origins.

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm run dev       # Start backend and frontend
pnpm run check     # Lint, type-check, and test both stacks
pnpm run build     # Production frontend build
pnpm run format    # Format both stacks
```

Backend migrations:

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/system-overview.svg" alt="Ledger Sync system architecture" width="100%"/>
</p>

The web import path is:

```text
Excel or CSV
  -> browser parser and validation
  -> authenticated JSON upload
  -> normalization and reconciliation
  -> PostgreSQL or SQLite
  -> analytics refresh
  -> TanStack Query cache invalidation
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for component and data-flow details.

## Deployment

The hosted installation uses:

| Service | Platform |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | GitHub Pages |
| Backend | Vercel serverless, ASGI |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL 17 with PgBouncer |

Frontend and backend deployments run from `main`. Database migrations run through the dedicated GitHub Actions workflow when migration or model files change. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) before changing production configuration.
